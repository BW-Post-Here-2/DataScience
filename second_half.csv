The remaining 10 teams would be done for the season. The survey sent to each general manager noted that “tiers” would first be created using the regular-season standings to ensure competitive balance between the groups.

>For example, the 20 teams could be allocated into five tiers in descending order by record.

>Tier 1: Bucks, Lakers, Raptors, Clippers

>Tier 2: Celtics, Nuggets, Jazz, Heat

>Tier 3: Thunder, Rockets, Pacers, Sixers

>Tier 4: Mavericks, Grizzlies, Nets, Magic

>Tier 5: Blazers, Pelicans, Kings, Spurs

>Groups could then be randomly drawn, with one team from each tier going into each group. The NBA is working on approaches to fairly balance the groupings, such as limiting each group to only three Western Conference teams, according to multiple front office sources.

The only knock on this achievement is that he only went 2-5 in those series. But to be fair, 3 of the 5 teams he lost to went on to win the title in the next round(Heat, Celtics, and Lakers).

nba,Proposed 24 team playoffs: NBA needs to take a page from the NHL,"NHL just recently released their plan to resume games. The format they selected works perfectly for the NBA as well and i think is something they should seriously consider. 

Top 12 teams from each conference make the playoffs. Top 4 from each conference are guaranteed a top four seed. They will play each other in round robin style to determine the seeding. 

The remaining 8 teams play each other in a best of five series to determine who faces the top seeds. Match ups will be based on standings. (5 vs 12, 6 vs 11, 7 vs 10, 8 vs 9)

Assuming the top four seeds remain the same after round robin, below would be the match ups. Also, 4-8 would be reseeded after winners are decided. 

*Edit: adding in that playoffs would resume as normal after all the teams are determined. Best of seven for each round. 

I honestly don't see any issues with this format. Thoughts?

I countered, saying you’d have to be the biggest hipster ever to be a non-canadian Raps fan. He disagreed, but it got me thinking."
nba,Making the case for Dwyane Wade as the 2nd best shooting guard of all time.,"I want to preface this by saying this is definitely a case of playing devil's advocate. I believe Kobe is the 2nd best SG of all time, and that the arguments I'm going to make rely too much on what-ifs to be very good. However, I think I can lay out just how close Wade came to challenging Kobe for the title 2nd best SG ever.


I'm going to structure this as peak for both playoffs and regular season, and then accolades. First, peak.

Wade's peak regular season is considered 2008-09, and Kobe's is considered 2005-06. I'll use per 100 possessions to account for pace.

Kobe: 45.6/6.8/5.8/2.4/0.5, 55.9% TS (2.3% above league average)

28.0 PER, 11.6 OWS, 3.7 DWS, 15.3 WS, 0.224 WS/48,  7.4 OBPM, 0.2 DBPM, 7.6 BPM, 8.0 VORP

1st team all defense, scoring title

Wade: 41.8/7.0/10.3/3.0/1.9, 57.4% TS (3% above league average)

30.4 PER, 10.3 OWS, 4.4 DWS, 14.7 WS, 0.232 WS/48, 8.2 OBPM, 2.4 DBPM, 10.6 BPM, 9.6 VORP

2nd team all defense (3rd in DPOY voting), scoring title


I think Wade's peak is overall better than Kobe's. He's scoring 3.8 less points per 100, but dishing 4.5 more assists, and he's scoring more efficiently. He finished 2nd team to Kobe's 1st team, but he had widely better defensive stats. However, advanced defensive stats are mostly trash. For another perspective though, Wade also finished 3rd in DPOY voting.

Now for playoffs:

Wade's peak playoff series: 

33.2/5.6/6.8/1.6/1.6, 65.0% TS

Kobe's peak playoff series: 

34/5.8/5.8/0.8/0.5, 62.7% TS

I think this is very close, with Kobe's being against the Nuggets in 2009, and Wade's being against Boston in 2010. Both good defensive teams. I'd call this a wash.


Now for accolades:

Kobe: 5 rings, 2 FMVPs, 1 MVP, 2x scoring champ, 18x all star, 15x all-NBA, 12x all-defense


Wade: 3 rings, 1 FMVP, 1 scoring champ, 13x all star, 8x all-NBA, 3x all-defense


Obviously, Kobe has the advantage here, but allow me to engage in the what-ifs I mentioned earlier.


Everyone remembers 2006, Wade averaging 35ppg to win the finals over Dallas. However, in 2005, the Heat were very close to another shot at the title. The Heat were up 3-2 to the Pistons, until Wade got hurt. He misses game 6, and plays injured in game 7, and the Heat lose the series. The Pistons go on to lose a tightly contested 7 game finals series against the Spurs. Now, obviously its a stretch to assume the Heat would've won the championship in 2005 if Wade stayed healthy, but at worst I think the Heat make the finals, with a good chance at a ring.


Then there's 2011. People remember LeBron choking, but Wade was the best player on the court for that series. Even further, the Mavs split the first 4 games, with the Heat losing games 2 and 4 by a total of 5 points. LeBron James averaged 17.2 points and 6.2 assists through the first 4 games of the series. Wade could've played just as well as he played, with LeBron putting up a 19 ppg instead of 17.2 ppg, and Dwyane Wade wins FMVP in a Heat sweep. 

Now yes, I realize those two things did not happen, and that they rely in what-ifs, it's the reason that this isn't a very good argument. However, I think it does lay out a solid foundation as to how close Wade was to challenging Kobe for 2nd best SG of all time. Just 2 swings of better luck, nothing to do with Wade's actual play, and Dwyane Wade finishes his career with 4 or 5 rings and 2 or 3 FMVPs, on 6 finals appearances.

This isn't meant to convince anyone that Wade is the 2nd best shooting guard of all time. I just wanted to lay out a foundation for an argument for it, even if it does rely on hypothetical.


What do you guys think?

nba,Isiah Thomas made zero All-NBA teams in the 4 years leading up to the 1992 Olympics,"I'm not sure why there is any controversy about Isiah being left off the Dream Team. He failed to make any All-NBA team (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) in 89, 90, 91, and 92.

During that same time span:

* Stockton was All-NBA 4 times
* Kevin Johnson was All-NBA 4 times
* Mark Price was All-NBA 2 times
* Tim Hardaway was All-NBA once

If the Dream Team selected another point guard, it should have been KJ or Mark Price.

Sam Smith, the author of “The Jordan Rules” and the former Chicago Tribune writer, poked some holes in the Michael Jordan documentary, as well. He said the notion Grant was his only source in the book was false and also laughed at the idea Jordan presented that himself, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Phil Jackson would all have come back on one-year deals for the 1998-99 season had owner Jerry Reinsdorf made them offers. Jordan instead retired and the Bulls rid themselves of their main championship pieces, entering a rebuild that went on for almost a decade.

“That was a complete and blatant lie by Michael,” Smith said Thursday on 95.7 The Game. “There were several things in the documentary that I saw, I would know, that he made up or he lied about. They weren’t major things, but it was like when a TV movie comes on and they say, ‘this is based on a true story.’ That’s what that was. It was based on a true story.”"

nba,"The Last Dance was a biased documentary, but the criticism is starting to get out of hand.","The Last Dance was, without a question, a biased documentary. However, lately the criticism surrounding this seems absolutely ridiculous. They told the whole story, didn't fabricate anything significant, didn't gloss over anything significant either. However, there was definitely small details that was presented in a one sided way, but nothing that changed the way we already looked at Jordan or the Bulls. 


I seen people call it nothing but a propaganda tape and MJ commercial. People say MJ has ""the entire plot under his full control"" and ""gets finals say on whats included and not"" etc. People say he is trashing his former teammates while making himself look like a god. That they gloss over his negatives while not doing the same for his teammates. 


Are we even watching the same documentary? 


They covered Jordan being an asshole to teammates, teammates being scared of him, gambling issues, missed game winners, the turnover in '95 that cost them a series, getting game winners scored on him by Armstrong and Miller, Jordan struggling in the '96 finals etc. What specifically did they exclude from the doc that was so important? Cause according to the creator Jordan didn't ask to have a single thing excluded. 


Did they let MJ comment on all these things to explain himself? Yes. Did they give that same opportunity to everyone else in the doc? Yes they did. 


Pippen got the opportunity to explain why he refused to enter the court and decided to say that he would do it all over again if given the chance. At that point its Pippen that makes himself look bad, has absolutely nothing to do with the documentary trying to give a biased view. 

They gave the man plenty of praise and they totally covered his bad contract, Jordan was very clear that they have no success and there is no Jordan without Pippen, his awsome road to success from such a poor upbringing etc. Same with Rodman. Were you guys even watching? 


Fact of the matter is that Pippen also had some questionable moments in his career. Should those have been glossed over? THAT would be biased if anything. They included his bad moments just like they did with Jordan and Rodman as well. Which is 100% fair. 


Then you have people pushing the narrative that Jordans teammates has been coming out to set the record straight. Who was it again? Oh Craig Hodges and Horace Grant, the only two guys who were already pissed at the doc for other reasons (being excluded/being called a snitch). Grant saying the doc is ""90% BS"" should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. 

What about the rest of the teammates, who took part in the actual doc, and said that they understood what Jordan was trying to accomplish and that he was pushing them? All the footage in the doc where his teammates were just laughing it off when Jordan talked shit? Lets pretend those dont exist. 


Then you have Rachel Nichols calling it biased for not including the Wizards years. Vernon Maxwell saying its biased for not including the Rockets winning the two years Jordan were retired etc. Like WTF? 


And for all the people saying Jordan was ""just"" an asshole. Watch the doc again. Listen to his teammates. They disagree with you. 


Fact of the matter is, most documentaries are biased, they are all pushing their agenda. If you think that Tiger King wasn't presented in a way that would make you sympathize with Joe Exotic and hate Carol Baskins then you are completely fooling yourself. 


This documentary was a biased view on Jordan and the 90's Bulls. Not worse than that. Its not propaganda, and its not trying to paint any teammates of his in a bad light, and it doesn't try to gloss over the negatives about him. 

Does it make you think than Pippen was a bum and Jordan carried those teams while acting like mother theresa the whole time? If thats what you wanted to see then yes. "

nba,"[OC] Jordan's ""Flu Game"" was also reported as food poisoning in 1997","Many doubt that Jordan's 1997 Finals Game 5 condition was because of gastroenteritis, or food poisoning. Michael Jordan, his trainer Tim Grover, and his friend George Koehler seemingly pulled this out of nowhere for some people. However, I remember my local TV station in 1997 describing it as food poisoning, so I've been confused by the narrative that ""food poisoning"" was something Jordan's people started making up recently. This, combined with my experience as a healthcare provider seeing numerous cases of bacterial and viral gastroenteritis in the middle of the night, made me much less of a conspiracy theorist on this than most. 

#First of all, was there even a pizza delivered to Jordan that night? It appears so.

>https://kutv.com/sports/utah-jazz/utah-man-says-no-way-pizza-made-michael-jordan-sick-for-flu-game-in-1997-nba-finals

>https://kutv.com/news/local/second-account-of-pizza-delivered-to-jordan-before-flu-game

#Second, what would be the differences in clinical presentation of influenza, gastroenteritis, and a hangover?

**Flu** generally refers to **influenza**, a virus spread through respiratory droplets. Although influenza can present with fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle aches, etc. - it is unlikely Jordan would have the flu without giving it to someone around him that series. And there is no evidence anyone else got sick.

**Food poisoning** generally refers to **gastroenteritis**, which is infection of the stomach with either a bacteria or virus. Sometimes it is called **stomach flu** which is a confusing term, because its etiology shares no commonalities with influenza. There are numerous bugs that can cause this, and some bugs cause predominantly nausea and vomiting while others can cause diarrhea, sometimes bloody. The explosive nature of Jordan's nausea and vomiting suggests - among viruses - norovirus (very common), or one of many bacteria, such as Staph aureus.

**Hangovers** - as many of you know, most commonly cause fatigue, thirst, headache, concentration issues, nausea, and stomach pain. However they very very rarely cause fever. For this reason, I personally find it extremely unlikely Jordan's symptoms were due to a hangover. Some suggest Jordan could have had altitude sickness, but if so, I would expect his symptoms in his first 48 hours in Utah. It would be exceedingly rare for such symptoms to pop up almost 2 weeks later, before game 5, in a hotel room.

#Third, what symptoms did Jordan even have?

>As this new season was about to begin, probably the most remarkable chapter thus far had been written the previous June, when he woke up violently ill before Game Five of the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. Whether it was altitude sickness or food poisoning no one was ever sure. Later, it was reported that he had woken up with a **fever** of 103. That was not true: His temperature was high but not that high, not over 100, but he had been so ill during the night that it seemed impossible that he would play. At about 8 A.M., Jordan's bodyguards called Chip Schaefer, the team trainer, to tell him that Jordan was deathly ill. Schaefer rushed to Jordan's room and found him **curled up in a fetal position, wrapped in blankets and pathetically weak**. He had not slept at all. He had an intense **headache** and had suffered **violent nausea** throughout the night. The greatest player in the world looked like a frail, weak zombie. It was inconceivable that he might play that day.

>Schaefer immediately hooked him onto an IV and tried to get as much fluid into him as possible. He also gave him some medication so he could rest that morning...

>Now, seeing him that sick in the Salt Lake City hotel room, Schaefer had a sense that Jordan might somehow manage to play, that Michael Jordan might, as he sometimes did in situations like this, use this illness as a motivational tool, one more challenge to overcome. He did make it to the locker room before the game, still frail and weak. Word circulated quickly among journalists that he had the flu and that his **temperature was 102**, and many assumed that he would not play.

Regardless of why you think he had those symptoms - hangover, influenza, gastroenteritis - this whole food poisoning business isn't new. Marv Albert repeatedly saying ""flu"" on TV probably influenced the oral history of that game more than any of the articles I included here."

nba,"Something interesting about each NBA team (Hawks, Celtics, Nets)","Pt. 1 of a series I might do

Atlanta Hawks:

The St. Louis Hawks were one of the best teams in the league throughout the 50s and 60s, but fan attendance always suffered especially when the team started to sign more black players and also because of the arrival of the all-white St. Louis Blues. Bill Russell was traded from the Hawks to the Celtics stating ""St. Louis was overwhelmingly racist. If I would've gotten drafted by St. Louis. I wouldn't have in the NBA."" Another instance of racism occurred when St. Louis blackballed their 8th overall pick Cleo Hill. Despite Hill dropping 26 points in his first ever game and having star potential, Hawks management ordered coach Paul Seymour to give more minutes to Pettit, Hagan, and Lovellete and diminish Cleo Hill's role in hopes of gaining a better in reputation in St. Louis. Seymour refused and was later fired. Bob Pettit became the player/coach and Cleo Hill's chances of playing minutes were gone. Hill's confidence was gone and he was released in 1962 and it is widely accepted that Hawks owner Ben Kerner requested to all the owners not to sign Cleo Hill and Cleo never played in the NBA again.

Boston Celtics: 

The Parquet Floor, the most unique basketball floor in history, saw some of the greatest players, teams, and games ever. Some sections of the parquet floor played on today is the same floor that Larry Bird and Bob Cousy played on. It is the only court that uses Red Oak and it is 12% harder than any other court in the league making the ball slightly less bouncy. Players like Sam Jones and Dennis Johnson used the dead spots to their advantage avoiding the spots on offense and heading opponents to dead spots on defense. So even when Bill Laimbeer spits on the Leprechaun or when KG kisses it, there is a certain mystique and beauty to Boston's hardwood that remains unchanged.

Brooklyn Nets:

KD and Kyrie Irving might of temporarily changed the Brooklyn/New York dynamic, but for most of Brooklyn's history they were always the bullied little brother. The feud between New York and at that time the New York Nets started in the ABA. The Knicks were displeased when hearing the news that they will have to share New York with another basketball team. The Nets were originally going to play in Manhattan but the Knicks forced them out 3 months before the ABA season started and forced the Nets to change their name to the New Jersey Americans too. However, poor conditions in New Jersey forced them to move back to New York and they again started over in New York as the Nets. Fast forward to 1976, the Nets applied to join the NBA, but were forced to pay $4.8 million to the Knicks for ""invading their territory"". The Nets offered Julius Erving to the Knicks instead, however the Knicks refused to acquire Dr. J (they wanted cash) and instead gave up Erving to 76ers for roughly the same amount the Knicks ordered. Tensions continued after the Nets attempted to move from Long Island to New Jersey, but once again the Knicks tried to block the move. This caused the only lawsuit between two teams in NBA history where the Nets sued the Knicks for violating anti-trust laws. Yet again, the Nets couldn't even defeat the Knicks in the court of law and they settled to pay the Knicks another 4 million in addition to an NBA fine forcing the Nets to swap 3 first round picks to the Knicks in 78/79 drafts. In the year 1996 fortunes changed for the Nets however. James Dolan needed approval from all owners in the NBA to own the Knicks but the Nets stated they would only vote for Dolan if the Knicks gave up the territorial rights in New York. The Knicks were cornered and were forced to agree and 16 years later the Nets found a new home as the Brooklyn Nets."

nba,Why do people hate on the 2013 draft class way more than 2014?,"The 2014 class received massive amounts of hype at the time. It was toted as the best class we had seen in recent years and even compared to 1996 class by slam (a class that included AI, Kobe, Ray Allen, Nash, and countless others). Looking back at it, the draft wasn't very good, the only real superstars who came out of it were Embiid and Jokic, and while it also produced some solid players like Smart, Randle, Nurkic and others it's fair to say the class was a big disappointment overall. On the other hand, the 2013 draft was regarded as a terrible year by most, yet it had talents like Giannis, Oladipo, Gobert, Steven Adams and CJ McCollum come out of it. I would argue 2013 has a slight edge talent-wise and it also didn't have any real disappointment considering it wasn't even supposed to be a good year, unlike 2014 which was supposed to be very good and was a flop. So why does everyone regard 2013 as such a terrible draft when 2014 was worse and more disappointing?"
nba,Manu deserves more recognition for 2004,"Manu Ginobili leading Argentina to a Gold Medal in the 2004 Olympics isn’t talked about enough. Him leading the charge in the win over the US in the semifinals made the USMNBT completely re-evaluate the entire organization. Argentina defeated the US in the semis 89-81, with Manu leading all scorers with 29 on 9/13 and 4/6 from deep. Argentina then defeated Italy to win Gold. 

It wasn’t a one man show, as Manu had NBA players such as Luis Scola, Andres Nocioni, Fabricio Oberto, and others by his side, but he was the definitive driving force behind that Gold Medal squad. Manu averaged 19/4/3/1.5 on 57% shooting over the course of the Games. 

I am a firm believer that Manu could’ve been the #1 option on an NBA team. He never had the chance in San Antonio, but he proved in 2004 he was capable of leading a team. Where do you rank Manu all time? I think he deserves to be in the conversation for top 50, but he’s a lock for the top 75 to me."
nba,I created a tool called PAWS (Preferred Award Weighted Score) where you can make your greatest NBA players list by determining the weighted value of different awards.,"**Background:**

I feel that a lot of the debate about the greatest NBA player lists is because people value certain parts of a player's career more than others. For example, some people may think championships are less about the player and more about the team. Or that all-stars are pointless because the fans and players make stupid choices. I decided to make PAWS so that people can see how their preferences affect who they think are great.

**Methodology:**

So, I started to create PAWS by listing most major awards a player can win. I then added 80 players in NBA history (mostly from ESPN's top 74 list) with their awards counts. You can now edit the weight of each award, and it'll give you a score to compare with other players using the same weight on their achievements. It will appear it graph form, where you can visualize different tiers, and tabular form where you can see the order and ranks more easily.

[**Here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zHdhsjfBV-kzvU2H66bkOIIxnOVvpyC6j94bejooMVQ/edit#gid=1130354099) **is the spreadsheet.** If you want to use it, **make a copy** and only edit the cells highlighted in **green.**

There are so many interesting things you can try to do with the tool, including trying to get certain players to the number one slot or just trying out different preferences. Keep in mind that values can be negative and if you think they are irrelevant, you can make them worth 0.

**Flaws:**

There are some obvious flaws, such as current players just don't have as much time to get awards as retired players, examples being Giannis and Steph. Additionally, there are players who impact the game far beyond awards, such as Reggie Miller. The last flaw I would like to bring up is the fact that it is difficult to quantify how dominant a player is outside of awards and statistics. Additionally, many awards are driven by storylines, such as Kobe only winning 1 MVP, and this is not reflected in PAWS.

There were many more statistics I could have included, and if you guys would want an advanced version of PAWS or more players added, just let me know."

nba,How the 24 team playoffs that the NHL would work in the NBA,"So if you were not aware today the NHL announced there plans to resume play today and I will be explaining how it would work in the nba. So basically what the NHL is doing is it’s still gonna be a traditional 16 team playoffs but they are adding a first round bye like the nfl does for the bottom four teams. So this is how it would look like

East

1: Bucks

2:Raptors

3:Celtics 

4: Heat

West

1:Lakers

2: Clippers

3: Nuggets

4: Jazz 

These following teams are all safe from playoff elimination and will do a round robin for seeding (I will explain that later)

Now the following teams will play a 5 game series to decide if they or another team will make the playoffs

East

5: Pacers

6: 76ers 

7: Nets

8: Magic

West

5: Thunder

6: Rockets

7: Mavericks 

8: Grizzlies

These teams would not be safe and would have a chance to be eliminated in a 5 game series from 4 more teams in each conference the 5 would face the 12 seed for a playoff berth,6 would face the 11, 7 would face the 10 and the 8 seed would face the 9 seed for a playoff spot this would like 

East

5 Pacers vs 12 Knicks 

6 76ers vs 11 Bulls

7 Nets vs 10 Hornets 

8 Magic vs 9 Wizards

West

5 Thunder vs 12 spurs

6 Rockets vs 11 Kings

7 Mavericks vs 10 Pelicans 👀

8 Grizzlies vs 9 Trailblazers

So those are going to be the best of 5 matches of the nba decides for 24 team playoffs. After that the regular playoff schedule begins with 1 vs 8 or 9, 2 vs 7 or 10,3 vs 6 or 11 and 4 vs 5 or 12 in there own respective conference 

Now the Round Robin. I was confused by this at first but it’s pretty simple. The 4 teams in each conference will each play each other once. 3 games in total for each team and depending on the record the that decides the playoff seeding so if the Bucks went 3-0 the raps went 2-1 the Heat went 1-2 and the Celtics went 0-3 then the standings would change and would look like

Milwaukee: 1

Raptors: 2

Heat: 3

Celtics: 4

This changed because the heat won more games in the round robin then the Celtics so they have the higher seed (Celtics fans don’t get mad this is just an example)

Now if the round robin were to happen we would see these matchups

East

Raptors vs Bucks

Raptors vs Celtics

Raptors vs Heat

Heat vs Celtics

Heat vs Bucks

Celtics vs Bucks

WEST 

Lakers vs Clippers

Lakers vs NuggetS

Lakers vs Jazz 

Clippers vs Nuggets

Clippers vs Jazz

Nuggets vs Jazz

these would be the round robin matchups we would see

DRAFT LOTTERY:

This is the confusing part and I’m not really sure I’m 100 percent right but this is how the lottery would go (I might be a bit wrong). So the 13-15 seeds from both conferences would automatically be entered in the draft lottery. Then depending on whichever team wins the the best of 5 the losing team will enter the lottery and be whichever record the bottom team is. For example let’s say the Bulls pull off a miracle and eliminate the sixers in a best of 7 then that would mean that the Bulls would now be the six seed and the 76ers now replace the bulls in the draft lottery and take there position and let’s say the pacers beat the Knicks in the round 1 matchup then nothing would change and the Knicks still stay in their current position. I’m not sure if this is 100 percent how the draft lottery will work however 

Hopefully this is a good explanation and now you understand how the NBA would work if the did what the nhl is doing. I’m not promoting this or saying this is what they should do but this is just a explanation on how it would work"
nba,Are the 19-20 Raptors the 93-94 Bulls?,"The Bulls were coming off a championship in 92-93, Jordan retires, they keep the team and they only lose 2 more games in 93-94 than the previous year. And they had 3 All Stars that year I’m pretty sure, Pippen, Grant and Armstrong.

The Raptors kept their team, lost Kawhi to the Clippers, but the roleplayers got better and Siakam is now an all star. If the season went as planned they would be on pace to about 59 wins, which would tie the franchise record set in 2017-18.

How similar do you think these two teams are?"
nba,NBA Viewership,"Hey everyone, for my marketing research class final project I'm doing a project on NBA viewership and would really appreciate all of your thoughts to my following questions! If you wouldn't mind, leave your gender and age range (for demographic purposes only). Thanks and stay clean!!

1. What would it take for you to pay for an NBA subscription (League Pass, TV subscription)?
2. Where do you watch your NBA games? 
3. How do you feel about ads/commercial breaks during broadcasted games? 
4. How long have you been watching the NBA? How has it changed media-wise?"
nba,"In addition to ""Wilt the Stilt"" and ""The Big Dipper"" Wilt Chamberlain was also nicknamed ""The Load"" and ""Big Musty""","Along with:

Dippy

Dip

The Record Book

All according to [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html) 

Definitely a mixed bag to say the least lol."
nba,What do you say to people who think that NBA is fake?,My Co-workers were talking about how NBA controls the teams' championships and the players are acting. They compared NBA to the WWE and said they're both just for show to make money. They had lots of other comments. I'm a NBA fan but I stayed quiet cause I felt I couldn't convince them otherwise. What would you say to them?
nba,"Cavaliers' Andre Drummond surprises worker with $1,000 tip at Florida restaurant",
nba,The Evolving Athlete Argument,"One of the things that brings passionate discussion to this board is comparing players in different eras. Obviously the argument will never definitively be closed, but one of the talking points that comes up is how today’s athletes are better trained and conditioned.

It is true, for sure. There are advancements in medicine, nutrition, equipment, diagnostics, training methods, travel, sleep/rest science etc. But if you take the athlete off the past and bring them to the present, wouldn’t they also benefit from the same advancements? Imagine a guy like Oscar Robertson plus the benefit of today’s science and technology."
nba,Bradley Beal tells a story about almost getting traded on his draft night to OKC for James Harden,
nba,Why did Jerry Krause hate Phil Jackson?,"Even after watching the Last Dance I still don't understand why Jerry came to resent and hate Phil so much. Phil is never shown or represented as someone to bully or demean Krause like Michael and Scotty would at times.

Was Phil actually doing things like the jokes those guys were saying or what?"
nba,Sources: Pistons starting search for GM to work with Ed Stefanski,
nba,"If Giannis does not win a championship thru out his career, what would your thoughts be?","I would be pretty surprised but then would think about all of the legends that did not get a ring. Chuck, C Webb, Stockton, Malone, Nash, Miller, etc. It is never guaranteed in this league and a new team can always come out of nowhere to change that. But if he does not get a ring and keeps getting MVPs, what would your thoughts be?"
nba,Tracy McGrady's BEST 40 Plays!,
nba,"Besides the Spurs, what are some examples of team culture?","I've heard a lot about how the Spurs have a selfless, team based culture, but never that much about others. What are some examples of other team cultures?"
nba,Does any team get more of an advantage from the proposed season/playoff re-start than the Rockets?,"Thinking about it, it feels like a big win for Houston and their title chances. They get to have a full training camp in the new system, and they get a fully rested Harden when the knock is usually he's gassed out in the playoffs. Plus the recovery of guys like Tucker, Covington and Gordon to leave them better equipped to take the beating in the post they'll have to survive in the playoffs. And assuming we go straight to the playoffs it's less games for other teams to scout the system (the counter arguement is that other teams have had three months to study the Rockets film). Not saying it makes them favorites or anything crazy like that, but it seems like a good thing for their chances barring something crazy like Harden coming back 25 pounds overweight."
nba,How high of an esteem do you hold the Sloan/Malone/Stockton Jazz for their year-to-year consistency?,"It seems like a lot make a big point about how the Jazz didn't win a Championship and didn't peak as high as other teams and use that to say the trio was ""overrated"", but does enough attention get given to just how consistent they were on a year-to-year basis while together, which was Spurs-lite in some ways. Here are their year to year records:

1988-89 (Sloan midseason replacement): 40-25

1989-90: 55-27

1990-91: 54-28

1991-92: 55-27

1992-93: 47-35

1993-94: 53-29

1994-95: 60-22

1995-96: 55-27

1996-97: 64-18

1997-98: 62-20

1998-98: 37-13

1999-00: 55-27

2000-01: 53-29

2001-02: 44-38

2002-03: 47-37

Total Record: 781-400 (.661), with 13 straight years with at least 47 wins (pro-rated for the partial seasons) and 12/13 with at least 50 wins (pro-rated for the partial seasons). You rarely see organizations maintain that type of year-to-year consistency. Really puts an interesting case study into ""peak vs. longevity"" discussions."

## Virtual Conventions

Since it's unlikely for large gatherings to happen for some time, some conventions have moved online with industry panels, Q&A sessions, cosplay, vendors, and more. We're gathering a list of them here to check out over the summer as well. (At least with these you don't have to worry about hotels...)

anime,"Recommendation Tuesdays Megathread - Week of May 26, 2020","
Need a recommendation or have one to share? This is your thread! This thread is active all week, so you can post in it when it's not Tuesday and still get an answer! :)

If you have a recommendation to share that's well written and longer than 1.5k characters, consider instead posting a [WT!] (Watch This!) thread.

If you'd like to look through the previous WT! threads to find recommendations or check if there is already one for your favourite show, [click here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JtLBsaUlkIYgokKV0CQo0naTL7TuVcTELturmAVRxo/edit#gid=0)

**Not sure how to ask for a recommendation?** Fill this out, or simply use it as a guideline, and other users will find it much easier to recommend you an anime!

*I'm looking for:* A certain genre? Something targeted like characters travelling to another world?

*Shows I've already seen that are similar:* You can include a link to a list on another site if you have one, e.g. MyAnimeList or AniList.

**Be specific about what you want!**

Don't have anything particular in mind? [Browse our recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/w/recommendations) for some common suggestions."
anime,I drew my most favorite animes' MCs,
anime,Kyoto Animation Arson Suspect to Be Arrested on May 27,
anime,I created an AI-based anime recommendation site! It's built on over 20 million user reviews and provides personalized results,"Hello! Are you bored during quarantine and need something to watch? Looking for a better recommender system?

# Introducing [kankoku](https://www.kankoku.co)!

kankoku is an anime recommendation site that looks at anime you’ve watched and provides recommendations that go beyond simple genre or plot similarities. It’s built on over 20 million user reviews from MyAnimeList and includes most anime prior to Fall 2018.

**How does it work?**

Simply upload your anime list (from MAL) and kankoku will calculate your personalized recommendations.  (You can export your list [here](https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export), and unzip it)

If you don’t use MAL or if you just want to look at a few anime, a dropdown selector has been provided as well.

[Check it out](https://www.kankoku.co)!

**How are my recommendations calculated?**

The model only looks at the ‘completed’ anime on your list, and disregards any ‘dropped’ or ‘watching’ records. These anime are then fed into an item-item collaborative filtering machine learning model, which returns a list of recommendations. Under the hood, a KNN model finds the cosine similarities of the ten nearest neighbors of each input anime, calculated based on other similar user’s reviews of those anime. Results are weighted based on your MAL scores (1-10 scale), so be sure to rate your completed anime.

Or you can just imagine Detective Conan sitting in the server room, calculating your recommendations in real-time.

**Why isn’t** *\*anime\_title*\* **in the recommendation list?**

Contrary to how other sites suggest content based on similar genres, kankoku finds similarities between anime at the user-review level. This method is similar to how Netflix pushes content, and is more accurate and effective than just looking at surface level data.

Furthermore, kankoku only looks at anime in its database – this includes most anime from mid-2018 and before. Sadly, this is a data limitation, and can only be fixed when a more recent scrape of user reviews is made available.

**How did you make this?**

kankoku is built in Python and assembled with Dash. Uploaded files are deleted upon exit, so none of your data is being stored or used for other purposes.

**Will kankoku support other sites (like Anilist) in the future?**

Sadly, the data format on other sites is different from MAL. If this was only at the export-level, it would be an easy fix, but often times entire anime titles and genres are coded differently. However, it is not out of the realm of possibilities to add this functionality, if enough interest is shown :)

**Why is an anime I've already watched in my recommendation list?**

Check if that anime is marked as 'completed' on MAL.

If yes, then it is likely due to MAL changing naming schemes a couple years back - like 'vs.' being coded as 'VS'. If you think this is the case, please comment or DM me with the problem-items, and I'll have it fixed asap.

**Issues or bugs?**

Please message me if you come across any issues – I’m relatively new to Python development, but will definitely look into any areas for improvement.

Stay inside and watch anime –

anime,Worst anime you’ve watched this season?,"Personally I was really hyped for this spring season. Then... Food Wars, Re: Zero, One Piece, Black Clover, etc.. all got delayed.

So I’ve resorted to watching some pretty shit shows to help pass the time. The top of this list (by a mile) has gotta be Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle. I guess it’s based on a video game or something which might explain why it’s story is awful and cliche. 

Anyone else think there’s a worse anime this season?

I know threads like this have probably been made before, but I didn't find any relevant to me. There are so many in my list, but I just want some simple slice of life feel good kind of anime to watch maybe something like the ongoing kaguya sama or tower of god, maybe something like saiki k, something light is all. 

I just don't want to watch something rlly emotional, sad and depressing in any way, as that just makes me rlly anxious, and I have been kinda avoiding anime because of this, because I refuse to spoil myself by reading the plot of the animes in my list XD. 

Please leave any recommendations will be greatly greatly appreciated!

**Comment of the Day**

[\/u\/No_Rex](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Rex) discusses the [factors](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/gql9yy/space_runaway_ideon_40th_anniversary_rewatch/frv7kgq/) that make the sub-light missiles dangerous to handle.

> It sounds crazy, but I think everything surounding the sub-light missiles makes a lot of sense (more so than any other technology around). I assume that they are dangerous because they can not be send from subspace on their own (probably because, on their own, they'd lose too much speed while exiting).

&nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

> Director Yoshiyuki Tomino decided to make the Ideon enormous so that it wouldn’t look quite as out-of-place next to structures and vehicles that we would have a greater frame of reference for.

&nbsp;

**Staff Highlight**

Moriyasu Taniguchi

> A veteran animator, director, and character designer with a prolific career who contributed many animation cuts to the series. Before becoming an animator, he had worked as a Nishijinori textiles designers, managing at a mannequin production company, and at commercialization for a film production company. Having debuted as an animator on the adaptation of Osamu Tezuka’s *Big X*, he was mentored at the time by Norihiro Okasako, and became a frequent animator for Toei and Sunrise in the 70s. He is said to have been struck by the design and presentation of the main character of Armored Trooper Votoms, Chirico Cuvie, which became his ideal going forward. Notable productions where he worked as an animator include *Fist of the North Star*, *Angelic Layer*, *Blue Comet SPT Layzner*, *Captain Tsubasa*, the *Cty Hunter* franchise, *Ergo Proxy*, *Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash*, *Panzer World Galient*, and *Fang of The Sun Dougram*.

anime,Anyone willing to host a re-watch for the main Studio Ghibli movies? They release on HBO Max tomorrow and I am planning to watch the main ones for the first time ever!,"So I have actually never seen any of Studio Ghibli famous movies and I saw that they will be available for streaming for the first time ever in USA on HBO Max.

I was curious if anyone was willing to host a re-watch for the main movies, and looking at MAL scores the top 7 movies all have a score higher than 8.27.

Which would be: Spirited Away, Princess Mononke, Howl’s Moving Castle, Grave of the Fireflies, My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky and Kiki’s Delivery Service. I feel like these are probably the main 7 I should watch?

I know this is last minute, but I would totally get involved in a re-watch, as this would be my first time watching and I already am planning on watching these movies when HBO Max starts tomorrow.

I am open to whatever, even something like 1 movie every other day. I just like the idea of seeing live comments about these movies, as well as people who have seen them many times, incase I have any questions I want to ask!

So is anyone willing to set up some type of rewatch schedule? It can be super basic, but I just have no experience in hosting these types of things."

I have only added those battles which contain two characters that I know, without a shadow of a doubt, are from an anime or at least are from a manga. I did not include those which came from visual novel games (like DDLC), those which only have 1 anime character, or those with zero anime characters. I will include those in a reply to this post. I am trying to play it safe.

Watch these battles and more. They are cool."

anime,Tried myself at the Sailor Moon Redraw Challenge ! I am currently drawing my own manga (i started drawing last year and try to learn more !),
anime,"Has anyone watched Soul Eater? If so, what’d you think of it?","I just wanna know what everyone thought of it. If you haven’t watched it, I highly recommend it."
anime,What anime you hate with passion?,"Straight up despise. I'm not talking about ""haha 7/10 not very good"" I mean you think is complete trash, people who watch it are delusional, should've never been an anime or even manga.

No bandwagon hate but anger, frustration, rage, impotence. Give me your worst rant and insults to that anime that you loathe with your soul."
anime,So what do I do now?,"Recently I finally finished the widely popular show ""Hunter X Hunter"" I started the show when I was 11 years old. A buddy of mine knew my home situation wasn't the best, he knew that I had problems making friends due to my horrible mother. I got to the heavens gate tournament arch before I had to stop watching for awhile. I went through a custody battle at 12 years old and had to tell the court about my mothers abusive tendencies, to go and live with my father. Fast forward to my 17th birthday with my girlfriend of 1 year, she mentioned to me that she was a huge fan of the show. Like any normal couple would we binge watched the show, we finished the show together and I cried...like alot😂 After watching it I had remembered the friend who'd showed me it in the first place. He was around 18 or so back when he showed it to me so I know he had probably moved around alot since. Talking to friend after friend, I got his Facebook, and while I don't really use Facebook, I got on and sent him a thank you message, talking about how much it meant to me just to have a show to put time into back then. Turns out that he had just finished watching the show with his daughter, and I think that's a pretty cool story to share"
anime,No one loves me so let me just watch people Fall in love,"I am looking for romance animes like Toradora or Golden time i dont really Care if its a harem, but nothing mecha 

If possible post a list of all the romance/harem animes you know of

Please make it so it redirects me to mal it would make it alot easier to go over the animes Thanks:)"
anime,What is it that makes something “well-written” and vice versa to you,"I honestly find it kind of funny whenever I see someone on here saying that they disliked a show because it had “bad writing” which is such a big aspect of filmmaking that it feels more like an excuse to not have to understand or explain what your problem with it is, from my point of view at least. So if you say that a show has “bad writing”, what does this mean to you? I know that “writing” can mean so many things to different people so that’s why I’m asking.

Edit: Repost cause the latest title was shitty and didn’t ask the right question

Edit 2: Not necessarily me asking what makes for a well-written show as it is something I’d say I have a grasp on. But more what you people think makes for one. It is very subjective and I’m interested in what other people think"
anime,Are the rumors about the season 3 of March comes in like a lion valid?,"There are rumors running around on twitter about a season 3, but it's more leaks than anything and I'm not gonna survive if it's actually false.

anime,Looking for anime close to a Chivalry of a failed knight style school and plot wise,I already eat used another one with the MC being a guy being able to conjure a shield in a school with other users who can summon other weapons so don’t recommend that anime if you know it

anime,Looking for anime to watch,"Hey guys,

I’m looking for somewhat popular anime (doesn’t have to be) to watch that’s fits the description of: School anime with op mc that hides abilities, anime where mc hides powers until needed, anime where op mc keeps to himself but still attracts attention.

Some anime that I like that are like this are classroom of the elite and irregular at magic high school (mahouka)

Sorry if I’m being too picky. Thanks"
anime,"Any isekai anime were the mc jumps between the fantasy world, and the ""real world""","I haven't seen any anime like this, and I suddenly had the urge to watch an anime like this. Manga's are also fine. Light novels too if they're really good."

anime,Is here someone who have similar feels?,"Hmm... After watch every anime, i have feel... i need more. For some exemple Tokyo Ghoul, Tokyo ghoul have ""happy ending"". But i have feel i need more... something no action, something chill from their classic day, some ""after story""..."
anime,Can I get some appreciation for the music of the Anime we watch?,"An often overlooked part of a lot of the Anime we watch is the music that goes along with them. I'm not talking about just anime centered on musical themes either (e.g. Carole & Tuesday, etc) I'm talking anything! Here a couple examples of anime I think have excellent music:

1. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War 
Season 1 and 2 have such spectacular and unique openings in my opinion the jazzy feal and the solid vocals are just amazing and really stand out in my mind.

2. Steins;Gate/Steins;Gate 0
Again the opening are good but I think the main star here is just the normal score. It has a distinctive sound and tone that really sets the anime. Gate of Steiner is iconic for that franchise and is memorable, melancholy, and tension building.

3. Cowboy Bebop
An iconic opening, several good vocal tracks throughout it's run and a clear sense of atmosphere what's not to like?

Is music in anime as important as I think it's? What are some of your guys favorite soundtracks from anime?"
anime,Looking for a specific Devil anime but cannot seem to remember its name.,"I am looking for an anime that has a Demon or Devil mother that can come to the human world but she only brings a portion of her power to enter the mortal plain as using all would cause destruction.

its been driving me crazy seeing that part in my head of a magic circle appearing and a young devil/demon comes out of it wanting to see her daughter.

If anyone can help bring a name to this anime that would be great.

I know its not:

High School DxD

Rosario Vampire

but do think it was a romance of some sort.

anime,"""Uramichi Oniisan"" TV anime additional cast",
anime,Sword Art Online .......,"**”If you watched SAO when you were young/a weeblet you would’ve enjoyed it. But when you have watched a good amount of shows , you’ll realise how generic and mediocre it is”**

I’m sure everyone’s heard/read this statement. 

Why is this not relatable to me ? I’ve watched so many shows (400+ according to MAL) , but I’ve never found any like SAO... 

It’s one of the few action+romance shows that keeps progressing the relationship and it’s actually a main focus. The only 2 anime that do this are Rakudai and Monogatari (I love both as much)

There’s a concept that’s nowhere to be found in anime. Tell me a show that deals with how **virtual worlds could affect the real world and it’s people** (except Accel world , cuz they are in the same world)

Call it boring or bad execution , but why does no one think twice before calling it “generic” ? That’s not what generic means ... 

The production value is also really high. You got amazing VAs , the OST is by Yuki Kajiura , and the animation is really amazing. In what sense is that “mediocre”. You can at least find 1 thing that stands out from this show

Did the words “generic” and “mediocre” lose their meaning ? Are they now just used to describe whatever show you don’t like ?

~~yeah , I’m triggered~~ 

Edit : what’s with the 4 word title rule ??"
anime,Akane from Psycho Pass,"What's with the hate around Akane Tsunemori? 

I found her the most interesting from the main cast. Everyone else was just badass cops with a role assigned to them, only Akane is the one that gradually changes throughout and it was interesting to see. Not saying I disliked the others , though.

Can anyone explain why you would dislike her ? Is it just because she's not badass enough compared to the rest of the characters ? ;-;

Edit : I have just watched Psycho Pass 1 (watching the rest of it now) , so when I read reviews and comments regarding her , everyone said how she was the most annoying out of the whole cast and her being naive was a problem too. 

Didn't know if she was well-liked after S1"
anime,Will Season 2 of Re Zero have an english Dub on launch day on Crunchy Roll,Not sure how they do things over at Crunchy Roll

anime,"Hey guys, I'm a real scientist that reviews the science in Dr. Stone! Today I reviewed the chemistry lab and eye glasses made by Senku",[https://youtu.be/gaydkRcfVUc](https://youtu.be/gaydkRcfVUc)
anime,Why do people not like long anime?,"From time to time someone will ask me for an anime recommendation and they'll usually watch them except when I recommend something over 50 episodes like Yu Yu Hakusho, One Piece or Rurouni Kenshin. I genuinely don't understand why though. Some anime start of slow or mediocre so I can understand not wanting to watch something that takes 20 episodes to get good. But One Piece has always been good in my opinion. Kenshin has always been good in my opinion. I don't know why people are so concerned about spending so much time on one anime if its good anime. Are you guys like this? Can someone explain to me the mentality behind this decision."

The Druid was doing most of the taking, and at one point said, ""Oh yeah?  Well we have a Bugbear."". Referring to my PC a barbarian Bugbear, long reach, extra carrying capacity, etc.

I immediately responded with, ""I unfold my arms and stretch them sideways, covering a 20' span.""

The Druid continued the talk, a fight broke out (it's a tavern, so), and we caught the guy.

That little reference to me in his discussion was very nice and confirming of the RP that I've (I'm the Bugbear) been trying to get across. It reaffirmed for me that the players know and accept it and my efforts.

DnD,Suckered a player into a card game with a fey and they said it was one of the tensest and funnest times they've had.,"The set up: The party just came off of their ""shopping"" episode in a town and have come back to the local inn to rest before leaving town. The bartender offers the party's bard a spot in a game being played downstairs and he says ""Well, I've got two gold to my name at the moment so maybe show me to the penny slots?"" The bartender replies that money isn't the buy in for this game.

This intrigues the bard enough to check it out. The bartender gives him a token which he uses to get past the guard for the game down stairs and he makes his way into the wine cellar. At a dimly lit table in the corner is sitting a goblin, a kenku, a kobald, and a pixie. The goblin, kobald, and kenku are all suspicious at first but the pixie happily invites the bard to sit down and explains the game to him. I go over that it's effectively texas hold 'em, each player roll 2 d13 and I roll 5 d13 in the background, reveal the first three numbers and then the last two as players make their bets. And then I explain that the wager is aspects of his character. For instance, he could wager hit dice and if he wins he'd get as many hit dice as he wagered on top of his normal ones, but would lose that number if he lost. And he could do this with anything, be it proficiencies, bardic inspirations, spell slots, even spells themselves where if he lost he would lose access to that spell but if he won I would upgrade the spell in some way.

After hearing the explanation he is very intrigued but just trepidatious enough to be hesitent. He agrees and we start the game. The players get their cards, bets are made, round and round until all the cards are turned over. By then he's wagered his Heat Metal spell, a point of dexterity, and his proficiency with performance. He's used performance and intimidation to make the kenku and the kobald fold but the goblin has wagered his courage so he calls. They flip their cards over and the bard wins. The goblin suddenly shrinks in terror and runs out of the cellar screaming and the bard now has a newly upgraded Heat Metal spell (I changed the damage die to a d10 instead of a d8), another point of dexterity bringing him up to 18, and expertise in performance. The pixie congratulates him, sits in the chair the goblin was sitting in and offers another game and the bard happily pushes back from the table, thanks everyone there, and quickly books it out of the cellar too.

Everyone said that was the perfect blend of exhilarating and terrifying and it was tense right up until the goblin showed his hand. It was super fun and I hope other DMs add it to their games. Sure it has the potential to make the player over powered but there's just as much chance to totally screw them over and it was a fantastic bit of RP."

How do you insure your NPC's stay dead in a world with scrolls and spells of raise dead?  Plane Shift is a good one, I plan on using that, as a scroll at least.   I sent my party to find a scroll of Raise Dead, only for it not to return in time due to the BBEG interfering (I had to put a house rule on Gentle Repose only adding 10 days total to the time limit on Raise Dead just to keep somebody with a scroll from showing up a year later going ""yeah, that succession didn't take"").

So how do you keep your beloved NP...err, victims *dead* when the cleric the next town over can just pop him back up?  Bodysnatching?  Into the swamp with rocks around the ankles?"

DnD,Need help with my character! I'm a beginner,"Hey, everyone.  
My best friend has been trying to get me into DnD for a while now, and I was finally convinced after playing a bit of Fire Emblem which gave me a lot of inspiration for a character that I thought would be fun.  


Problem is, I do not know how to distribute my stats for my character, how important each skill is for my chosen class and race (Tiefling Order of the Lycan Blood Hunter), and what would make sense for the theme I'm going for.  


His current random stats are 12 STR, 12 DEX, 13 CON, 13 INT, 11 WIS, 10 CHA and I have four more skill points to spend. I know STR and INT are really good for him but idk how to use all four points efficiently for him. Odd numbers have no point from what I've heard.  


I'm taking heavy inspiration from ""Fallen Male Corrin"" from Fire Emblem Heroes' physical appearance (you should look up his voice lines for context, as it may help you help me figure out what to do here), and the Hunter from Bloodborne's fighting style. My Tiefling's personality is going to be a lot more different, but his fighting style would be similar to how the Hunter or the Chosen Undead use Great Swords.  


My Tiefling is a lone mercenary as not many people trust Blood Hunters, OR Tieflings (from what I've heard), so he just sits somewhere around town, polishing and cleaning his weapons, sort of like ""advertising himself"" as a reliable and careful fighter so that people would maybe offer him jobs to take if they see past his intimidating demeanor. He's actually a very gentle and selfless person who just wants to be treated the same as everyone else, and can even be quite the romantic/romanticist when he feels completely open with himself (or if he's drunk and around a person he's interested in, or just women in general), as he tends to enjoy escaping from reality by reading books of brave heroes where they defeat the dastardly villain, and rescue their love interest.  
However, due to the circumstances of his birth and class, he has no choice but to kinda mask his true personality as not many people would actually trust him if he were to act all like that. They would think it's just an act. So, ironically, he has to make an act that he's really a dark and brooding person to hide his true personality, so that people wouldn't find him untrustworthy for acting like a unusually friendly Tiefling.  
Because of this, he's quite sad, but once the party recruits him, I'm planning to make him really pleasantly surprised that someone would actually want him to travel with them, show off his true personality for a moment but then catching himself and going back to how his ""alter-ego"" is.  


Sorry for lengthy post. I hope this was comprehensible. This is my first time with a character."
DnD,The alternate path to raise dead,"I posted an article that develops a new path for slain PCs and NPCs to return to a campaign game. It's definitely plot driven rather than a function of game mechanics alone. See link at the bottom. Feedback is welcome.

DnD,Lance Knight Build.,"Got my boy Ser Carth Galador. He is a Joyous a jolly Knight. He is from a land far away, and his stead Calmert is of the most loyal sort.

A lance and mounted combat would seem appropriate. But the lance doth not have great weapon, or versatility. I asked the dm himself, and he proclaimed it would be possible to craft a lance in such fashion. 

However would it be worth it? And how would opportunity attack work? If i rusheth at an enemy and hit him whilst achieving sentinel status, would that prevent him from attacking me in the same turn?

Could the speed of mighty Calmert prevent an opportunity attack? I have to admit, i am not familiar with the full concept of mounted combat. But by my troth, i intend to learn with full intent of bringing honor to House Galador and the Kingdom of Boon."

DnD,How do I get my player’s attention again?,"We hit a point in the game where they have a lot of different story threads to pull on and the next step is basically up to them. My intention was to wait and see what they’d do, but then Corona hit, and we didn’t play for awhile. Now it seems like everyone’s lost their motivation to play(which I understand). Normally my solution would be to throw something new and unexpected at them, to suddenly wrap them up in something completely different, but there’s already so much going on, I feel like I’d overwhelm them if I forced anymore story onto them. It really is best to let them choose the next step, but until that decision yields consequences and interesting story beats, I worry the players will be bored. 

It stinks, because I know there’s a lot of cool stuff right around the corner, but they have to be the ones to actually *walk around the corner.* How can I capture their eagerness to do so again?"

DnD,I can’t use cities anymore. [5e],"In my party, there are a ranger, a druid, a bard, a sorcerer, a cleric/warlock, and a rogue. Everyone but the ranger is Chaotic, and mostly CN at that. 

Every time they’re in a crowded area, the kleptomaniac bard with +15 to Sleight of Hand finds the richest people around and robs them. The rogue gets bored pretty easily and either sleeps with the NPCs or kills people. Already, they’ve burned down a tavern with everyone inside (except for a baby whom they had their NPC monk rescue) for being racist, murdered people with no regard for their families (when they killed the bouncer outside the tavern, they found a note from his young child wishing he’s be safe), and looted the body of a child who died as a result of an enemy mage’s poorly aimed lightning. That was just one session.

At this point, they’ve accrued enough money that even a CR 15 inflation monster can’t stop them from buying any random magic stuff they can find, and I’ve already established that shops selling magic items exist in some cities.

The plan for the plot involved quite a bit of city-hopping as the players investigate diplomats from a distant nation. The problem is that cities are where the players get even more stupid-rich,  kill innocent people, and generally be Chaotic Chaotics. The only line they have yet to cross so far is killing children, which they generally dislike and avoid.

I’m trying to send the party into wilderness areas, but I can’t keep them out there forever without completely freezing the campaign’s plot. What can I do to keep them from becoming far too powerful far too fast simply by virtue of destroying things and stealing stuff? (Consequences for their Actions are already in the works. I’m looking for creative solutions.)"

Is there anywhere online I can find an art page for weapons and armor for 5e similar to the one for 4e? I want to have the visuals to help my new players find their look.

DnD,Joining Online Groups?,"So it's been a while since I've played D&D (5th Edition), and recently, I've really wanted to get back into it. However, I don't have a group to play with IRL, and I won't (likely) be able to find one until school starts back up. So, to fill the time between now and August, I was considering joining a group online (yes, with strangers). However, I wanted to get some opinions on this idea first.

My only issue is that I'm only lv 5. This seem like a lot of stuff for me to have at this level. Most of my party members don't have any magic items near my cloaks level. Should I ask my DM to nerf it to balance the party? Or should I wait and see?

DnD,What has been your greatest nat 20 moment?,
DnD,Need to understand : Undead Fortitude,"Hello everyone. New DM here.
I was wondering something about the rule for zombies : Undead Fortitude.

Does the DD of the test is only calculated with the last damages which have put the hit points at 0 (or less) or with all the damages who bring the hit points to 0 ?

I mean by exemple : 
Zombie Guy gas 2 hit points left. It takes a hit that does 7 damages, bringing its hit points at 0 (and under) for the first time.
Its DD to reach with Undeaad Fortitude is 5+7 with in Fortitude. It manages and is back at 1 HP.

Next turn it takes 6 damages.
Does its DD is 5+6=11. Or does it's becomes 5+7+6=18 ?

Writing this an question spawned in my mind, does Undead Fortitude only work once ?

Thank you by advance to all those who will take time to answer me."

### /r/buildapc is recruiting - apply to join the modteam

Hi all, we’re looking for a couple of new moderators to join us on /r/buildapc to help ensure the smooth running of the subreddit and [discord server](http://discord.gg/buildapc). If unpaid, underappreciated internet busywork is your idea of a good time, then read on.

On the subreddit, you’ll be helping us to stay on top of the moderation queue, responding to modmail queries and generally making sure users aren’t murdering each other over their choice of CPU cooler. The responsibilities are more or less the same for discord mods, only in real time.

We don’t necessarily expect an encyclopaedic knowledge of PC building, but are looking for users with a bit of composure and a history of positive, helpful contributions across this kind of community.

The only requirements are 2FA enabled reddit and discord accounts. Pay is competitive with other subreddits (that is to say non-existent).

To apply, simply fill out the form below before June 5. We will be in touch via reddit DM, so keep an eye out.

[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7VSZ0KCmqhhVH6KD6jfWnZ7utz7eeTRLwU6hxGGyZIDvlcg/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

CPU: Ryzen 3600

MOBO: MSI Tomahawk Max

buildapc,Smell coming from newly-built pc,"Sunday I finished building my first pc. First boot everything works, all the fans are working, stuff was lighting up, etc etc. It worked.

It still does, but yesterday I started to notice a weird smell coming from it. I could smell it in the whole room.   It doesn't have a ""light"" smell like chlorine. It has a heavy smell, maybe a bit like something is burning (rubber?). So I decided to turn it off, switch the PSU off and unplug it. 

I checked the motherboard but it all looked normal from what I can tell. No burn marks, nothing. All the fans are still working. But I did find out that I accdentally routed a cable under the VRM heatsink, so I rerouted the cable and tried booting it up again. 

The smell is still there. I checked the GPU temps but those are all fine. My CPU shouldn't be overheating because it has an overkill cooler and I applied enough thermal paste (maybe a tiny bit too much, but nothing major). 

The smell is at its worst at the rear and top exhaust fans. I made sure to smell the PSU as well but it doesn't have a  very noticable smell, not like the smell I smelled yesterday.

Can somone please tell me what might be going on? Is this just a ""new pc"" smell? What can I do to make sure it's not something bad?

* What can this tells us about any games that could get DLSS 2.0 support in the future? Are there certain games that we already know just won't get supported by DLSS because they don't meet a certain requirement/have a certain system in place that prevents DLSS support?

buildapc,Full Rebuild with i7-10700K and ASUS Z490-A drivers not installing,"###Troubleshooting Help:

**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Intel i7-10700K

ASUS Prime Z490-A

Corsair 16GB 2x8 D4 3200

EVGA RTX2070 SUPER FTW3 ULT 8GB

Samsung 970 EVO m.2 NVME

850 W PS



**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

As of yesterday, I did an upgrade/rebuild using the parts above. I was able to post, install windows, and begin updating drivers. 

The disk that came with the motherboard had several drivers, including the chipset driver, network, realtek audio and a few others. When attempting to install these drivers from the disk, it was able to install the intel chipset driver, and it would go through each of the others as if it was installing them, but after ""installation complete: restart computer"", the other drivers are not installed. Because of this, I cannot use my network.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

To fix the problem, I went to the motherboards website and downloaded the newest version of all these drivers. When copying them over and running them, the drivers still are not being installed.

I also went to intel's website and downloaded the drivers to update the Intel network I225V drivers. When running this, it says no intel network devices were found.

I tried flashing the newest BIOS version of the ASUS Z490-A also, which didn't seem to help either.

In windows device manager under other devices, it shows the network and various PCIe drivers not being installed and thus can't use them. I borrowed a USB wireless network device, got connected to the internet, and attempted to use windows automatic driver search function, but this also wasn't able to install the drivers.

**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

Replace this text with your answer.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

With this being relatively new parts, I can't seem to find any information on solving this, so my new build is just a paperweight right now. Any information would be greatly appreciated!"

buildapc,"Board won't post, feel like I've tried everything. Please save me!","OK, I'm in the build from hell. 

Currently, I can get everything on the board to power up but get no video and a VGA Debug light.

I've tried:

- RMAing the Ryzen 3700x
- two different sets of RAM
- Two different GPUs (borrowed a friend's)
- two different power supplies
- this is my second MOBO

I have confirmed the GPU and ram work in another system

I have tried seating the ram in every possible way, going one stick at a time in each slot just in case

I have tried moving the GPU to multiple different PCie slots

I have tried assembling the system both in and outside of a case just to check the grounding

I have unplugged and replugged, and re-seated every component no less than half a dozen times

The Mobo does say ""Ryzen 3000 ready"" on the box so it shouldn't be a ""flashing the bios"" issue

both the 8 pin, and 24 pin power connectors are connected and I get lights and fans, just no video + the debug light

I have tried multiple cables and multiple monitors, both of which work with my other system

I've scoured the internet high and low, and am feeling incredibly frustrated. Someone please rescue me and tell me what dumb mistake I'm making

edit: also I've cleared the CMOS both with the button on the board, and by removing the battery at least half a dozen times between re-seatings.

and also have tried plugging HDMI into both the GPU and board just in case (should be GPU but im to the point of trying everything but voodoo)

buildapc,Is my GPU okay?,"Hi I just built a PC a few weeks ago and everything runs fine but sometimes I get random crashes while gaming, and I have occasionally gotten a few full computer crashes that go to the Windows blue screen with errors ""CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED"", “Kernel_security_check_failure”, and one more that had to do with my RAM.

Oh also, my audio will stutter pretty frequently while playing games, but this doesn’t always lead to a crash. 

I am fairly sure my problem lies with my GPU but I’m not really sure what to do about it. I have tried DDU and readjusting my nvidia settings, but the problem persists. I have tried benchmarks and everything seems fine. 

My specs are:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X

GPU: Nvidia RTX 2070S (Super)

SSD: Samsung 970 Evo NVMe PCIe M.2 1TB

RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3600 C18 2x8GB

MBD: MSI B450 GAMING PRO CARBON AC (MS-7B85)

PSU: Corsair cx650m 

I am running this on two monitors, both 1080, one is 144hz and the other is 60hz. I have tried with just my 144hz, but still got crashes. Could a bad DisplayPort cable cause issues like this?

I may try a clean windows install if it keeps happening. 

Any help would be really appreciated."

I don't mind doing tech support for this person - they are the kind of person that will just turn it off until I come around if it's not working, no big deal. They are generally really low-key and just happy to have something that works some of the time.

* email
* facebook
* netflix/other media
* skype

That's pretty much it. I'm also considering adding some apps that may assist with cognitive function, but the main thing is: 

**What can I do to make this easier on them while using it?** 

I'm trying to think of ways to lock it down a bit, to prevent problems, and also ways to make it easier to read (beyond scaling, already there). Also, anything that optimizes for a senior citizen would be great!

buildapc,First-time build temp issue?,"Hey guys, first-time builder here - I recently put together a build and have been tinkering with various settings, but I'm seeing my idle core temperatures \~94C. 

The goal was to play / stream league of legends & play star citizen, with various other games mixed in but of less importance. Currently, I can run league of legends on about medium settings at about 60-100fps, with occasional chop. Star citizen is an entirely different story. I can run it at about 9-24fps depending on population density and activity. While trying to optimize my system for SC I found that my processor was running at about 80-95C IDLE.  CPU utilization seems way too low and is around 10% during gaming. 

I guess I have a few questions: 

1. Am I at risk running at these temperatures for long periods of time? 
2. Do these parts look like a processing bottleneck to the veteran eye? 
3. Should I *do* anything? or continue gaming and hope for the best?

I've tried the radiator as an exhaust at the top, and as an intake on the side with pretty much the same results, I've tried multiple different thermal paste application methods with no joy for some reason my temps have gone through the roof and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of things to try?  


Looking at the radiator it looks like some of the fins got a bit damaged during the process but I wouldn't expect that to make this big a difference unless one of the coolant lines got damaged?"
buildapc,Do I need a new motherboard?,My current one is a BIOS one from around 7 years ago. I’m planning on upgrading to a brand new pc. Sorry i don’t know the specifics but I’m not sure how to check.
buildapc,Looking for some feedback on this £650 build for a friend,"I built my own PC last year, and I'm now trying to help a friend build one for around/under £650

I don't need storage or any peripherals/monitor. I'm just looking for solid hardware that will get the job done, no need for RBG kits or anything like that. Ideally around $2000 would be good with a max budget of $2500.

buildapc,"Windows won't boot, safe boot / USB Boot have black screen.","So my PC was normal until I noticed that Windows Explorer kept crashing, than after a Reboot my pc got stuck into windows loading, and after some hard shut downs when it goes to Recovery Environment, after ""Preparing Automatic Repair"", a black screen would appear forever, then I downloaded windows and from the bootable usb I repaired startup problems and It worked, but the windows explorer kept crashing, programs were not opening, task bar not responding, everything was glitchy, I runned sfc /scannow, it said that everything was repaired, so I rebooted my PC, and then same thing happens, infinite loading windows, black screen on automatic repair, but this time, this time the bootable USB was also leading to a black screen, I downloaded windows again and used Rufus instead of normal Windows Media Cration tool, didn't worked, updated bios, didn't worked, can't use onboard video since ryzen 3600 doesn't have integrated graphics, b450 tomahawk mobo, other monitor had same error, tried stick rams separatel, tried removing my SSD where is my windows, and only let an HDD that is just for storage, didn't worked, and since I don't have access to windows recovery / bootable usb, I dont know what else can I do.

TL;DR Infinite windows loading, black screen on both windows repair environment and bootable USB

Tried: 

Updating bios

Removing HDD

Trying only one of RAMs stick

Making different USB format with Rufus

buildapc,First AMD build - mobo navigation,"Hey all, while I've built a PC before and know my way around the computer fairly well, I've decided to try building my first all-in AMD rig.  
It'll be multi-purpose - mostly browsing online, light gaming (no FPS, but more Dwarf Fortress, Don't Starve, Oxygen Not Included, Fallout 3, WoW maybe, Total War: Warhammer, and Crusader Kinds, etc), and video streaming.

Trying to fit into a decent budget, I've decided on monitor, cpu, and gpu for what I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) is the better balance of price/ performance for me.

Just trying to figure out the best mobo for what I have going now.... I've heard that I'll need to look out for BIOS flashback, take into account VRM, & PCI-e 4.0, etc etc.  Coming from a tech & video post-production background, it's always my first instinct to get bigger/ better, but as I've changed careers to cybersecurity (& I'm poor from the schooling), I don't think I'll necessarily require anything so hefty - especially if it can save me money and I won't really see/ notice much of a difference in performance.

I'm debating on whether or not to go mATX for the smaller form factor (not much space for things) OR go case-less ATX & mount it on my wall (which will also save on space).

Preferably looking for two m.2 nvme slots so I can dual boot Win10 & Linux.  Space for a 2.5 SSD would also be great for my media storage, but I can always get a dock for my drives...

buildapc,Need help with DisplayPort cable...,"I built a computer recently and would like to upgrade the HDMI cable that came included with my monitor to a DisplayPort cable so I can enable gsync.  My GPU uses DisplayPort version 1.4, but the monitor uses version 1.2.  Does this matter when choosing a cable?"
buildapc,Choosing the right GPU,"I looked at many compies GPU products, and I got a lot of different models like overclocked, higher frequency, triple fans, and water-cooled GPU. what would be the best company to buy and choose a cheap and futureproofing GPU style for gaming?"
buildapc,Fan Always Running at Full,"After a couple months playing around with my new build I updated my BIOS and reinstalled Windows 10 to get a clean slate. But now the system fan runs at full speed all the time, even when the computer is at idle. Even when I’m sitting in the BIOS doing nothing it’s running at a full 1300 RPM. It doesn’t make sense because I set the same custom fan curve I did during my last install. Even worse, changing fan settings in the BIOS doesn’t change the fan’s behavior in any way now. The RPM is the same whether the BIOS fan controls are set to Full Speed or my manually drawn custom fan curve. 1300 RPM at all times.

The only time this changes is during boot. When the computer first boots the fan goes to full. It dips to near silent when the Windows logo first pops up, and then it goes back up to full again. Those couple seconds are the only time the fan isn’t running at full. Any advice on what might be causing the problem or how to troubleshoot this?

And for what it’s worth, I don’t have any fan control software installed in Windows because, from what I read on here, my motherboard manufacturer (Gigabyte)’s software for that is garbage.

(Case) any 60 dollar case I can find with good airflow good quality interior and decent fans

(Psu) 60 dollars I'll find something 

(Motherboard) msi b450 tomahawk 

Total $800


Sorry if the second build is incomplete but I listed the amounts I'm willing to pay and what I'm looking for in that price range I will do more research later on.

All help appreciated"
buildapc,Simple PSU question,"im no special case, but i was wondering if a 550w psu is necessary for this build. i will probably do some safe overclocking.

buildapc,2ND monitor advice,"Hey People,

&#x200B;

I am looking to buy a second monitor replacing my current monitor to game on ( Samsung curved Full HD 24inch cf390) as the primary.  The samsung will be my secundary one. 

I thnk I am looking for a 144hz monitor. But does it matter if I take a 1440p or 1080p monitor. Also does it make a difference if one is 24? and one is 27 inch?

&#x200B;

Any onther stuff i should look out for? 

My specs:

Intel 6700

RAM: 16GB 3000mhz

GPU: 1070"
buildapc,"Is different latency, different MHz, different model of ram work together I need to upgrade my ram.","I have HyperX Fury DDR4 8gb 2133MHz CL14 Ram
I need to upgrade my ram from 8gb to 16gb.
But the ram im using is out of stock or may be discontinued
So can i install HyperX Fury DDR4 8gb 2400MHz CL15 or Different Brand Like Corsair 8gb LPX DDR4 PC4-19200 2400MHz

Motherboard - Gigabyte B360M DS3H
CPU - Intel i5-8400

Thanks in Advance"
buildapc,RAM upgrade.,My friend needed better RAM and I have some extra money so I figured why not sell my current set to him and use that money and save some in a sense and buy a better more future proof set for myself. I plan on taking this computer to college and will probably run some hefty programs so I want to get 32gb. Is CL16 ram really that much better than CL18 (about a $30 difference I think). Also what speed should I get. I plan on working a ton this summer and getting a newer better GPU from my R5 1600 to a 3700x or maybe better. Should I go straight to 3600 or is like 3200 enough?
buildapc,"Is it just me, or is there somewhat of a PSU shortage at the moment?","Hey guys,

So I've been looking around trying to find a semi-decent PSU that is less than 600w to use as part of a Minecraft server PC build - I've had no issues finding most of the parts I'm after for decent prices (well, at least, decent prices considering the current circumstances...), but the PSU is eluding me.

I don't know if it's just me, or just in the UK or something, but it seems that most PSU's at the moment are either unavailable or ""item has not been released"" (which can't be true, as most of these PSU's have been out for years) on Amazon.

Here are some examples:

It's only once you start to get to PSU's that are over £80 (which is to much for a budget server build in my opinion) that you start to find some in stock, like this [Seasonic Focus GX 550W](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07WQYM74W?tag=pcp0f-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1).

So, has anyone else found this, especially when looking at budget PSU's? Why is it out of all components, that PSU's seem to be the only ones widely out of stock?"
buildapc,Guys i have an issue with fan length...,I have a case called Deepcool MATREXX 50 RGB with 3 fans front and 1 fan back. And one of the fan headers seems to be short and isn't long enough to connect to the MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max motherboard. Is there anyway u could guys help? 
buildapc,Cpu choosing,Which is the best cpu for gaming and streaming? Ryzen 5 3600 or Ryzen 7 2700x
buildapc,How should I dedicate SSDs for a dual boot video editing PC / Hackintosh in terms of speed & heat dissipation?,"Hi all, this is the build I'm going for: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hnRpL2 My goal is to rebuild in a Ghost S1 whenever I can get one so I can travel with it more easily.

And according to [Puget Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7zI7MYSY_0&t=39s), the ideal setup would be 3 drives - OS, Media Files, Scratch Disk. Now, the mobo I have has one NVMe slot with a great heatsink - it takes off almost 20C under load from what I've seen. So I can assume that the 2nd NVMe slot on the bottom will be really hot because it has no heatsink and is sandwiched between the mobo and the metal of the case.

From what I can estimate, 1-2TB should be enough for Media, 500GB-1TB should be enough for a Scratch Disk, and I need at least 500GB for MacOS to allow for certain DropBox folders to download. 

Is my best option to have two 2.5"" SSD's as my boot drives, 1 main NVME formatted as ExFat for Media + the occasional PC game I might install, a second ExFat NVMe in the back slot as a Scratch Disk? 

Additionally, could I reduce the number of 2.5"" SSD's to just one that is partitioned to dual boot and would that affect performance?"
buildapc,New build for 144hz 1080,"I play a lot of esports titles that don't require heavy graphical settings. A few notes before you check it out:
The 1660ti is barely more expensive than the super, so makes sense to go for that.
I do plan on upgrading to a 3000 series gpu at some point, and perhaps ryzen 4000 so would I be better off getting an x570 board instead? 
I already have an HDD so i just threw a random one in there.

buildapc,Should I take GTX 1660 Super (260€) or RX 5600 XT (299€) ?,"I made a post not so long ago if I should take the GTX 1660 Super or the RX 5600 XT but some things changed. First of all, I wanna build a 75Hz rig and I wanna keep it for next gen games. I have two choices for the GPU : the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse and the Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super Gaming OC. Here are my specs :

Total: $734.06  
I'm hesitating between the Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super and the RX 5600 XT.

The GTX 1660 Super costs 260€ and the RX 5600 XT 299€. My monitor has Freesync but only with HDMI, meaning that Nvidia can't support G-Sync. The RX 5600 XT outperforms the GTX 1660 Super, but the drivers of the RX 5600 XT are a hit or miss. The GTX 1660 Super, however, has stable drivers, but I'm afraid it can't keep up 75FPS on next gen games. AMD has not so good OpenGL support, which is still used on certain emulators, but Nvidia has good OpenGL and Vulkan support.

So, which card should I get ?"
buildapc,Putting together a ~$2000 build for a friend. Can I get some second opinions? Haven't put a build together in around 4 years,"https://pcpartpicker.com/user/swirle13/saved/#view=9HmcTW

My friend is looking to put together a build including monitor, mouse, and keyboard for about $2000. He expressed interest in 1440p 144hz and mostly gaming uses but also photography and normal computer uses. He was fine with the ~$2200 price point given the performance he'll be getting.

He's also going for a mostly black/white case with no/minimal RGB. 

I chose the 3600 to pair with the 2080s because higher resolution gaming is more GPU dependent than CPU and the 3600 is really strong still. I chose the cheapest AM4 X570 mobo so he can drop in a better CPU in the future if he chooses as well as having 4 DIMM slots if he wants to expand as well. He won't be needing wifi and will be using ethernet. This could be swapped for a 10400 and a comparable mobo if it makes sense.

I chose an NVME 1TB SSD so it's very fast, and I know it's QLC so it's not going to be great for moving large files but since he's never had a PC, he won't have anything to migrate and his use case doesn't seem to require large file transfers. I want him to experience NVME speeds for his first PC ever. 

2TB Seagate HDD for mass storage. Filled by parametric filter, so no reason for it in particular.

PSU was just a solid 750W one for a reasonable price, but not tied to anything about it in particular either.

Let me know any questions about parts or anything, thanks"
buildapc,"I want to start my first build, but i’m young and don’t know where to start","Hi everyone! i found this sub today and it’s perfect timing. i really want to start my first proper pc build, because i’ve been using my school laptop and it’s really not meant to run games. 
i mostly play minecraft but i would also like for it to be able to run fortnite(for my brother) and the sims 4 cause neither of them will run on my current laptop. i would also like to be able to play new games and stuff i can find on steam. 
only issues is, i am currently too young to get a job due to my age (i will be able to in january), and i’m unsure if any will be available due to the current events. 
does anyone have any tips on good starter equipment that isn’t too expensive? should i build myself or should i buy it outright? can i get away without buying certain pieces at the start, without it running badly?
i live in Ireland, so places that ship there or the UK only preferably. 
if anyone needs more detail, they can pm me :)"
buildapc,Looking for monitor recommendation,"I'm looking to buy a monitor around 27"". It would mainly be used for reading documents and watching movies. Not really for gaming so refresh rate isn't important. I'm guessing an IPS would be best. I've got mixed advice on 4K (or 2K), some say it's pointless while others say it makes the text appear sharper? Would features like LED or HDR make a difference? From what I've seen you can get an affordable monitor with a few of these things, but to get certain combinations (like high refresh rate and 4k) it's really expensive. My budget is $300-$500 CAD.

Any specific suggestions or general advice?"
buildapc,I don't know what GPU to upgrade to...,"Right now I have a GTX 1050 Ti, an intel i-3 8100, 8GB of RAM.

I want to upgrade my rig and I think I'll go with a GTX 1660 SUPER first, then CPU, then RAM...

So I was looking at the prices for a 1660 super and they range from 200 to sometimes 400 dollars.

Could someone help me choose what one to buy?

Thanks in advance!

PS: if you think I should go for a different GPU please tell me"

buildapc,First PC,Do all AMD processors come with thermal paste on the bottom of the fan ?
buildapc,What do you use SATA ports for?,"I'm just curious if there's additional peripheral usage I'm missing. Most Mobos seem to come with 6 SATA ports as standard, but I don't think I've ever seen people strongly recommending 6 internal hard-drives in a build. Years ago one might have been occupied by an optical drive but they're barely used these days. I know some boards have M.2 space that closes off two SATA ports too, but in general it seems like there's usually an unused abundence of SATA ports.

&#x200B;

I'm just curious what people use them for. I like getting the absolute most out of anything I use/do, so discovering something I hadn't thought to include would be nice."
buildapc,Question on Sound card,"Would something like this have any phishing/keycloning programs on it?

[Ebay - USB Sound card](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5-1-USB-to-3-5mm-mic-headphone-Jack-Stereo-Headset-3D-Sound-Card-Audio-Adapter/312877734870?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=611601547806&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)

I'm weary of it being so cheap. Or, am I just being paranoid? My Tomahawk Max is having awful white noise issues for the microphone and I'm going to try a USB sound card to fix it

Thanks all!"
buildapc,How likely is it that the HDD LED pins on my mobo are dead?,"I installed a new case today (Zalman K1) and everything is working fine except the HDD LED. Power and reset buttons are working and the power LED is working as well. However, the HDD LED is dark. But when I connect the HDD LED cable to the POWR_LED pins on the mobo, the HDD LED lights up. I don't see anything on the mobo that could indicate that it's broken or whatever, all the pins are there, nothing is bent. I know it's not a big deal, but I just want things to work fine on my new PC."
buildapc,Is it worth waiting until october before buying a PC?,I just have a tough time deciding whether I should build something now or wait until around september/october. The ryzen 4000 and nvidia ampere are rumoured to will have came out by then but you can never be sure when there is the whole coronavirus situation. On the other hand I'd like to get my hands on a new computer asap cause I have a lot of free time during the quarantine. What are your thoughts?
buildapc,Has anyone here purchased a used PSU? If so what's your story with its performance?,Just curious I've heard a lot of negatives of buying used PSUs. I understand there can be risks and we don't need to list them out here please. I just want to hear from the people who took the risk and purchased a used power supply and how it went.
buildapc,How to get cooler off of dead motherboard?,My motherboard shit the bed the other day and I’ve read that you should stress test to warm up the thermal paste to make it easy to remove but I can’t do that in my case. Any tips to get it off easily?
buildapc,A good motherboard you should check out,"I have been looking through a lot of posts about motherboards for ryzen 3600, 3600x, and 3700x and everybody keeps recommending the tomahawk and while it’s a great board there’s another motherboard from msi that has nearly identical vrms but lacks a usb c port and that is the b450 gaming plus which in my area is only $10 less than the tomahawk but in some areas it might be even cheaper. Some people don’t like the minor red accents but if you are looking for a great b450 atx motherboard then it is an awesome choice. They make a micro atx and an itx version too. If you want micro atx there is also the mortar max as well."

buildapc,1st time builder looking for advice,"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nFqLL2

How does this build look? I'm a gamer and a musician.  I plan on playing games and streaming myself to Facebook/YouTube live (playing music not games, so its just OBS and a webcam/audio interface). I also do video editing and photoshop. 

I tried to do all Amazon because I get 5% back. This may have made me make some questionable choices. Any help is much appreciated!"
buildapc,"Recent first build, need help diagnosing problem with video playback.",Recently completed my first build and everything went smoothly and has for two weeks but noticed that when i have two players opened my chrome will lag. I thought it would have to do with my ram but i wasn't sure if that would have anything to do with the problem. Any help is appreciated thanks.
buildapc,GPU temperature and airflow,"I have a Radeon RX 5700 and the temperature seems pretty high compared to others I've seen online. It usually stays at around 45c when I'm not doing anything at all. I used FurMark to test it under full load and it got up to 75c and stayed there for a minute but I didn't want to push it too far so I only let it run for 5 minutes. I've only played a couple of small games so far so I haven't tested it out on any bigger games yet

&#x200B;

My case is a Cooler Master H500 and I'm using the two 200mm fans it came with as intakes at the front and I have two 120mm fans (one at the top and one in the back) that I'm using for exhaust. There's room for one more 120mm fan up top but I'm not sure if it would be better to use it as an intake or for another exhaust. What do you think?"
buildapc,Website advice,"I'm looking at making my own first build but also at pre-builds from various sites, has anyone had a build from fierce pc? I can't seem to find reviews for their £8-900 builds."
buildapc,Ryzen 5 3600 GPU,What’s the better GPU to pair up with a ryzen 5 3600 MSI-GeForce GTX1660ti gaming X 6GB or EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 KO 6GB
buildapc,Tax on Pc?,Hi I was wondering how they tax you on your pc build if you are ordering your parts off of PC parts picker. Any replies would be greatly appreciated.
buildapc,Should I get Bluetooth 5.0?,"I have a WiFi card on my PC with Bluetooth 4.0. I’ve had some issues with my keyboard connecting when starting up. Which made me look into it and I see my keyboard has Bluetooth 5. 

It seems like a pretty inexpensive upgrade, but will it make any difference?

buildapc,Looking for PC recommendations,"Hello
I'm considering getting a gaming PC. I'm looking for one that could run games like squad, post scriptum, hell let loose and war of rights on medium to high settings. I'm on a budget of up to $900 any recommendations would be welcome."
buildapc,PC won't boot into windows with GPU installed,"When I have a display cable going to my gpu I can enter the bios just fine but when I try to load into windows the screen goes black. A few times it has managed to get to the log in screen but it is at the wrong resolution before it goes back to a black screen. Occasionally it will try to boot into windows recovery mode. The fans on the gpu continue to spin so it doesnt appear to be a power issue. I have tried using different PCIe slots and different display ports. I can't even reinstall the drivers because I can't get into windows when the gpu is plugged in. I'm currently trying to download older drivers through Guru3D. 

Is there anything else I can try?

r9 280x

i57600k

ASUS ROG b250f gaming mobo

8gb RAM"
buildapc,Upgrading from i5 6600K,"Hey guys, just wanted a little bit of help thinking about a potential upgrade for my PC. I currently have an i5 6600K processor and ASUS Z170-P mobo. This build has honestly worked very well up until COD Modern Warfare, and I'm realizing that 4 single threaded cores just isn't going to cut it anymore. I have a  **Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 8 GB AMP! Edition** and it is still crushing, so I will probably be fine with my video card for at least another year maybe longer. 

&#x200B;

What mobo/cpu combos exist that would be on the cheaper side that would outperform my current setup? I guess I could spend around $400-$500 but even that is a little steep, the cheaper the better! If anyone is curious this is my full setup that I built a few years back, the only thing I've done was add more storage.

BUT I have also read about not being the right time to build a pc due to low supply, prices going higher and higher or the upcoming next gen)which im not looking for top tier stuff)  So I looked locally for gaming PCs and found this 3 USED options which I could add or remove parts with the spare money (I would appreciate your recommendations)

\*First Used $600 Option: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JtkvQq](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JtkvQq)

buildapc,"First high-end AMD system, looking for feedback","Hi everyone,

I'm looking at putting together a new system to be a workstation/gaming rig. I've done plenty of intel builds but this would be the first AMD system I'm building, so just looking to get a sanity check as to whether or not this makes sense or if there is anything obvious that is a compatibility issue or otherwise should be changed - for example I've heard quite a bit about Zen being picky with RAM, so that's my biggest concern, but also have seen a lot lately that with 3rd gen it doesn't matter as much as it used to.

I'm not 100% set on these specific parts, but I'm generally going for aesthetics and performance over cost.

buildapc,Recommendation: Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh Airflow,"At 99.99 USD this mid-tower case comes with a mesh front panel. Three RGB fans which are installed on the front panel.
Has all kinds of room for building.
Fits large tower cpu air coolers.
Easily fits my 3 slot RTX 2080 with plenty of room the spare.
Has hidden SSD/HD caddies
Comes in black or white to fit your build.

Airflow is awesome and at full load and OC my RTX 2080 never breaks a sweat. Top temp at full load has been 64c.

CPU is air cooled and it also stays nice and cool.

I think this revision of the TD500 is newer but I would recommend."

I know I don't have a lot of space for a graphics card.  I have seen other posts say that I'll need a better PSU and a low profile card.  Additionally, the Precision has an i5-6500 and a m.2 slot whereas the Optiplex has an i7-3770 with no m.2 slot.

I am partial to the Precision, for the m.2 and it looks like it has more space for a longer video card.  I'm not sure which CPU has more power in it, but I don't see why I cant swap them.

oddlysatisfying,"Starting today, YouTube links are not allowed in /r/Oddlysatisfying","After some consideration, we have decided to implement a new rule. Going forth, YouTube links will no longer be allowed as submissions to /r/oddlysatisfying
##Why?
During the course of moderating the subreddit, we came to notice a lot of YouTube submissions were spam. Beyond those, however, we looked at the recent [YouTube link submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search/?q=url%3Ayoutube.com&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) and noticed that they consistently score very low on this subreddit, indicating that even amongst the non-spam YouTube submissions, users very rarely find them *oddly satisfying*.
While we do not wish to restrict what can be considered ""oddly satisfying"", as the meaning of this term varies from person to person, in this particular case, given the consistently low scores and the tendency of many of these links to be spam, the mod team is hopeful that this change will benefit this subreddit.

&nbsp;

The addition of ""no YouTube links"" has been added to the Rules, under Rule 1: Banned Topics.  Use this for reporting posts submitting YouTube links if some get through the cracks (which always happens).

Cheers."

relationships,My parents don't understand that I'm 23F and want a life outside of our extremely small town and possibly our extremely boring state. How do I explain this to them?,"Throwaway because I don't want this associated with my regular reddit account.

I'm an only child, and my parents have always been overprotective. When I was a kid, everyone knew my parents sheltered me. It led me to doing a lot of sexual things when I was in middle school, way too young to even understand that it wasn't okay. Both my parents are agoraphobic (they have a fear of leaving the house), they've done everything from home – online school, remote work, have their groceries delivered. They don't believe in therapy and refuse to get help. They try to get me to switch to online college and try to influence me to get a remote job. Before the pandemic, they were literally living the quarantine lifestyle. I wasn't. Anyway, I didn't realize how much I was being sheltered until I was about 16 and they had a giant issue with me driving. They let me buy a vintage car with my own money, but later admitted that they only let me do that because they knew it would never work, therefore I could never use it. This was the first huge issue I remember having with my parents, because everyone else was driving and I couldn't up until I was 20 years old. Plus, they lied to me and got me excited to drive this awesome car when they knew I never would be able to. This was kind of an embarrassment to me, because at every family gathering, everyone knew my other relatives around my age were allowed to drive and have a life while I wasn't. No one really understood why I still wasn't allowed to drive at 20 years old. On top of this, they tracked my phone whenever I did anything (even going out to eat with my grandparents). I went to college about a half hour from my house and lived there solely because they didn't want me driving. In college, I did a lot of things I regret – I smoked, drank, got in random guys' cars, got in an abusive relationship, and had sex with people I barely knew. It was so fun to be independent. Over time, I finally bought a better car, was allowed to drive, and gained more trust from them somehow. I moved back home for grad school and that's where I'm at now.

About a year ago, my boyfriend and I went on a trip that was about a four hour drive. As a result, my parents didn't talk to me for three days. When I graduated college and was considering moving to a different state for work, they asked me ""what they did wrong to make me want to move so far away."" The other day, I mentioned a cute venue that I saw online where I would love to have my future wedding, which is a three hour drive – they asked why I hate them so much that I would have my wedding ""somewhere other than our backyard."" They refuse to understand why I want a life outside of our rural, boring town. Every time I even mention moving to our state's most happening city, they get mad and say ""ew... why would you want to live there?"" They want me to get a job at the school down the street from our house (I'm studying to become a teacher) and my dad keeps saying the quarantine is a ""dream come true"" for him, because he never wants to leave the house again. They won't let me go to my boyfriend's house and are threatening to not let me back in the house if I go there. They almost wouldn't let me take a job that would've changed the whole trajectory of my career because they didn't want me going out even though it was once a week and I wouldn't be near anyone except one or two people at all times. I understand very well that the pandemic is a serious issue, but the fact that my parents ""won't allow me"" to see my boyfriend or go for a bike ride is really bothering me – like I'm 5 years old when I'm 23F.

What's bothering me even more is that when this is over, I'm going to have to have the talk with them about moving out and possibly moving to a new state. This is something I want very much – I'm getting tired of being unhappy, not living my life to the fullest, and seeing all the other people I grew up with moving far away and living out their dreams. My boyfriend and I are musicians, and the thought of me not ever even TRYING to pursue a career in music is extremely bothersome. I at least want to try. But I'm afraid of the huge backlash I'll get if I move away. ""Why do you hate us so much??"" ""Why wouldn't you want to live here??"" ""Why would you want to move out??"" ""The grass isn't always greener on the other side!!"" ""You'll get killed!!""

I feel horrible even writing this – I love them, I just don't know how to explain to them that I want to have experiences without them reminding me that ""experiences are overrated.""

TL;DR: My parents are extremely overbearing, overprotective, and agoraphobic. How do I tell them that I want to move away and have life experiences without them telling me I don't love them or don't care about my family?

Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for all of your comments, I never imagined I'd have this many! I read all of them – so thank you to everyone even if I don't respond to all!"
relationships,My [29F] SIL [27F] is pretending online that my infant son [9months] is hers,"First of all, I apologize if this post is all over the place. I am very distressed by this situation. So, I found this out from FaceBooks recommendations. SIL always says she has no social media presence, that it stresses her out which is understandable so when I saw the profile, initially, I thought it was a fake. Someone got ahold of her pictures and made it for whatever reason, but as I scrolled the profile almost all of the pictures were either of my son, or of her with my son and the posts detailing ""mom life"". I was very unsettled. 

For some history, SIL has some mental health problems. Bipolar disorder. She holds down a job though and handles her business so I always assumed it was well controlled with medication. It never bothered me and I was never wary of her being around my son. I let her babysit all of the time. Also noteworthy, she cannot have her own children due to some blood thing but she always said she never even wanted kids. She did have a miscarriage several years ago and was told she would never carry to term. She took it well if you believe what she says. 

I only slept 4 hours last night I'm so freaking out about this. My husband, her brother, doesn't think it's a big deal and says she's harmless. He always defends her. She can do no wrong in his eyes. I'm starting to rethink many of her behaviors and things she says, like she has a very dark sense of humor and says things If we're out shopping and she sees a cute baby she'll go ""I want to steal it"". My anxiety is so bad I don't know if am overreacting or not. 

Tldr: SIL is pretending my baby is hers on Facebook. Husband unconcerned. She has a history of mental illness and miscarriage. Is this just something some women do to cope? Am I overreacting? How do I handle this situation?"
relationships,I (20f) have a really weird problem where I can’t call my boyfriend (21m) by his name,"So, I have this really really weird and silly issue where I find it awkward to call my boyfriend by his real name. He has a perfectly common name (it’s not associated with any trauma from my past either) but whenever I text or talk to him, I use the nicknames that we have for each other, like babe etc. In the 2.5 years that we’ve been together, this has always been the case, so somehow it has progressed to the extent where I can ONLY use those nicknames. Just saying his real name out loud feels extremely awkward. I really don’t know why!! For the record, he doesn’t find it disrespectful at all and we were just laughing about it because it’s actually pretty funny, but I would love to be able to say his name again without feeling like I’m calling a stranger. How should I go about fixing this? 

Tldr; I have only called my bf by nicknames and that became the norm and now I find it difficult to use his real name, what should I do?"
relationships,My (25 F) and my partner (28M) cannot agree on finances,"\[This is a throwaway account\]

Me (25 F) and my partner (28M) have been living together for four years, together for seven.

I am in grad school in a tech-related field that will likely get me a good job, and currently do an internship that pays me very little. I am almost graduated. He works in a tech-related field, earning a very good salary (more than 3x my income). Our relationship, aside from this issue, is great: we see eye-to-eye on everything, are happy together, have great discussions and love each other.

However, we can’t seem to agree on finances, to the point that it’s really hurting our relationship. Because he insists on me paying almost the same amount as him to common expenses such as rent and groceries (even though my contribution is still less than his), I nearly spend 90% of my income on common expenses and really need to save in order to buy things for myself, such as a book I like. In contrast, he pays less than half of his income on common expenses and can thus spend every month on expensive gadgets and fun things. It’s really starting to grate on me, because if he even paid a little bit more to the common expenses I would also be able to do and buy more stuff for myself.

However, every conversation we have about it results in a fight. He considers himself a libertarian and thinks it’s already very generous he pays more than me. When I tried to convince him with logical arguments to pay a percentual part of our income (“we are a community, and society also has percentual taxes”) he gets angry, defensive, and upset, telling me he feels like I’m trying to take his money from him and “his lifestyle”, or that taxes are not comparable to our situation and that “our situation is working well”, or that I would still be reliant on his income even if we went to the percentual system. 

Important fact: he got this job after we had been together for several years (so it’s not like I am a golddigger), before that he had been living off his parents, including his mother who lives off a small pension, and got a job after I had been telling him this was not very adult of him.

I also get upset, because I really cannot comprehend how he can happily talk about money he spends on nice things while I don’t have money for anything. I told him, upset, that it seems harsh and cold and that if the situation were reversed, I would happily pay more of my income to let him have more to spend on himself. His response was “I don’t deal in hypotheticals”. He also claims he is doing more housework (which is true, my grad school sometimes has me make 12 hour days after which I am too tired to do anything), which he claims cancels out that I have less to spend for myself. After another fight today, he finally agreed to put only a small amount more - but he made me feel like I had to beg for it. I also told him it feels weird to me he keeps emphasizing I should be grateful.

The weird thing is: he does have future goals like “buying a house together”, but I don’t see how we can do that if he insists on each paying half, or if he doesn’t want to talk about a common financial plan.

I think personally it also has to do with him being an only child that was spoilt by his parents: he is not used to sharing anything, and commonly shared loads really feel like a burden to him. I also feel like his family did not really teach him financial responsibility, nor prioritized it. Example: before this month, even though he had 3x my income, he didn’t save and just spent it all. This is the first month in his 3 years of working he has saved.

Is there anything I can do or say to talk about this and maybe convince him? Is this a reason to decide not to focus on a longer term relationship, even though anything else is going very well and I see myself spending the rest of my life with him?

TL;DR: partner of seven years refuses to talk about finances even though I am unhappy with the financial weight each of us pulls in this relationship: he earns 3x as much as me but refuses to pay significantly more in common expenses. Talking about it results in fights and defensiveness: how to deal with it, possibly convince him? Also: maybe this is a good reason to think about not being together in the longer term?"
relationships,First date advice? I am a 16M who comes from a conservative family and I need a lot of help.,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read my post. So I am going after quarantine on my first ever date. I cannot stress to you all enough about how oblivious I am to flirting. 

I have a really outgoing personality but with that my flirting skills are like as follows:

>Girl (16F): Bullshit, you are so good looking  
>  
>Me: Thanks

So what I was wondering was what do I do on the first date? 

\- Do I hold her hand?

\- What happens if I have to kiss her, which lip, what do I do?

\- Do I throw my arm around her or is that too forward?

\- Do I hug her or is that creepy

\- What should I say and not say?

\- What do we even do? Like ideas for a first date?

\- How do I act, I am a very 'warm' person but I don't want to come across as overbearing

\- Like what conversation topics?

\- What compliments should I give

\- What is flirting that could come from her side? 

\- What do I reply with

\- How do I calm myself down?

\- What should I do and not do?

**Tl;Dr: I am oblivious to flirting and I need tips and stuff to really tell me what I should and shouldn't do**

I feel like I am asking too many questions, but once again thank you for taking your time to read my post. Any other advice would be 10000000000000% useful and taken into consideration.

Once again thank you."
relationships,My partner (35m) of five years has never dated anyone older than 21 or been in a long term relationship outside of myself. Are those red flags,"Hi so I am a 23f who has been dating my partner, a 35m for five years now and I haven’t been exactly happy in our relationship for the past few months. Of course I did the dumb girlfriend thing and began to overthink things and that’s where it kind of went downhill. I began to piece things together and realized that in all his relationships, his SOs were never older than 21. He has dated about five-six women since high school and two were while he was in high school so yes they were under 21 but after high school he was the guy going after the high school freshmen and having mental breakdowns over them. One of the girls was a young, work acquaintance, another a young childhood friend, and the last was a childhood friend’s little sister. The others were I believe just high school girls going to college parties. This went on until he was about 27-28 and he took a break from women but still flirted with younger girls. None of the five (the sixth girl I cannot quite remember may have been 22-23) relationships lasted more than a year. When he was 30, he met me and we began dating. He has slightly shit talked his former exes but also like...they were under 21. People under 21 in general are immature. I don’t know if he has ever stopped to realize that. 

Looking at it now...it kind of seems like a red flag? The “never been in a long term relationship” I could maybe sideswipe because there are plenty of people who are older than 25 and have never been in a long term relationship, but the ages of his SOs? I may be overthinking it because I’m unhappy with him right now but it comes across in hindsight as a bit predatory. Am I being paranoid?

Edit:
Also when we began dating I had to tell him to stop communicating with one of his online friends that he had been talking to for about 4 years. She was 19. The age at which he began talking to her made me uncomfortable and I told him that. He threw a fit and said I was being overly possessive and didn’t see what was wrong with him having female friends. He finally agreed and texted her goodbye, saying I had told him it wasn’t okay to talk to her and she just never responded and blocked him lol.

My 35m partner has never dated someone under 21 or been in a long term relationship outside of myself and I’m feeling like those two things are beginning to look like red flags"
relationships,Am I F(29) overreacting about my boyfriends M(31) “friend”?,"Am I overreacting about my boyfriends “friend”?

My boyfriend has this “friend” who is a female. Lets call her Sarah. Sarah and him dated a few month prior to when I met him but never worked out due to something out of both of their control. I won’t go into detail but basically they would have continued dating if this “thing” didn’t happen. 
He was up front about her in the start of our relationship but I was always kinda iffy about their friendship. I’ve vocalized to him my feelings towards her and he said “she’ll always be his friend and he doesn’t like to burn bridges.”

Fast forward to last week, my boyfriend and I got into an argument about how he doesn’t comfort me enough when I need him to or doesn’t offer assistance when I’m clearly in need. For example: if I were to cut my hand while cooking, he would run away instead of asking if I need help or a towel or a bandage. 
Well yesterday, I got sun poisoning. I was puking and severely dehydrated. He never asked if I needed anything or what he could do to help. Instead, he just sat on the couch watching tv and playing on his phone. 
I was finally feeling better so I joined him on the couch. Well, he got up to go shower and left his phone. I wanted to continue watching the show so I grab his phone to press play (it was being streamed from his phone) and a message pops up from Sarah. Apparently they were joking around or something because she said lol and some other words indicating it.

I was so pissed and still am. I’m in the bedroom feeling like I’m on my deathbed and he’s choosing to sit in the living room and talk to her. I haven’t spoken to him since I confronted him about the message last night and don’t plan to. He’s upset at me now because I’m giving him the silent treatment but I’m so upset that I don’t know what to even say. 

Tl:dr Am I overreacting about my boyfriends “friend”?"
relationships,"My Grandfather died recently, and it's really taking a toll on my [17M] younger brother [6M].","So my 6 year-old brother has severe Autism, and has always been really close to my grandfather. My brother would always seem to cling to my grandfather whenever he was around and they got along extremely well. Recently, my grandfather passed away due to complications with covid which has really taken a toll onto all of us. Though this has taken an even bigger toll on my brother. I don't quite think he comprehends quite exactly what has happened, but you can definitely tell that he's been a lot more down recently. 

The only thing that has really cheered him up is animal crossing. The other day though, the Nintendo Switch broke. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but when you turned it on, it got EXTREMELY hot, and then simply would run extremely slowly; it was basically unusable. I tried fixing it, but it didn't seem like it was an easy fix and I have no idea what exactly is wrong. So now it saddens me that the only thing that kept him contempt doesn’t even work anymore. I tried getting him on games such as Minecraft and Stardew Valley, but he struggles with the controls as he was so used to the Nintendo Switch. So have no idea what to do anymore.

And financially, we simply aren’t in a position to get a new Switch as my Dad recently got laid off due to the pandemic, and they are a lot more expensive now due to the increase in demand. I was thinking of selling my PC at one point to help him, however, I need it for Uni. So I have no idea what to do. Where do I progress from here to help my brother cope?

Sorry if this was a bit rambly and long.

TL;DR: Grandfather died, younger brother with Autism has struggled to cope. Nintendo Switch broke making it even harder for him to cope. We can't afford a new one. I don't know what to do next."
relationships,Is it weird that my boyfriend (18) bosses me around/takes charge and I (21M) like it?,"Apologies for any mistakes. I've had a reddit account for a few years but I've never used it till now so I'm still learning the ropes. 

My BFs (we've been dating for around 2 years at this point) parents told him that when he turned 18 he wouldn't be allowed to live at home because of his ""unholy lifestyle choices"" so I told him he could move in with me. A week after he turned 18 I helped him pack his things and he moved in with me.

Due to the current global pandemic, we've been home alone and we've grown a lot closer and he's taken the assertive dominant role in our relationship. 

Words can't describe how much I love him and how much I want him to have everything so naturally whenever he tells me to do something, that's my top priority. I just get a thrill out of doing what he tells me to. 

He also has a habit of teasing me about my height and it strangely turns me on. I'm 5'3 and quite skinny but he's 6'5 and pretty muscular so he literally towers over me and he's obviously physically more powerful town me. Quite often he'll put things out of my reach and tbh I enjoy climbing around to get them. He'll even lift me up to get the things that he put out of my reach. It's hard not to get a b*ner when he uses his strong hands to lift me. Sometimes when he's playful he'll even hold me up in the air with one hand.

Sometimes in bed, he'll make me the little spoon and he'll jokingly remind me that he's in charge and there's nothing I can do about it and he can make me do whatever he wants. And no, he's never ""forced"" me to do anything I'm uncomfortable about. 

TL;DR Is it weird or unusual that my boyfriend being assertive and dominant really turns me on and I'm genuinely happy being ""obedient"" and submissive?"
relationships,My(24F) Bf(25M) 1.5yrs accuses me every day of being unfaithful.,"Tite pretty much says it. Almost every single day my BF accuses me of cheating on him. Leaving bed to sit on the couch,  feeding my parents cats when theyre on vacation, going to the store. Doesnt matter what im doing, its all suspicious to him.

This morning, we had a talk about how my new birth control is supposed to stop my cycle and how I havent had one in a while, and as luck has it, I got it a few hours later and he blew up on me. I had stopped an old prescription about 2 months back and started a new one 4 weeks ago and hadnt had my cycle in that time, so I also took a pregnancy  test to be sure. He said all of it wasnt a coincidence and any other person would walk out the door right there. 

Anytime im on my phone, browsing the web, watching videos, reading emails or messages, he always asks who im talking to, if im talking to my other BF, or quickly comes over to look and see what im doing.

I work long hours. Sometimes 12-14hrs with a partner, usually male,(private security patrol) and that has always been an issue for him. Being called to go into our office is an issue, working extra hours is an issue. 

Im a very private person and dont like going out places or having anyone over. I work 8-14hrs a day, 5-6 days a week, and the rest is spent at home. I dont have any friends and not much family. I have 1 kid with my ex-fiance, who lives with my ex-mil because she adopted him, and its always been an issue talking to/being friendly with my ex to gwt pictures, videos, updates, and times I can see my son. 

I just need to know if im doing something wrong here? I dont feel like im doing anything to be accused of this so much.

Tl;dr BF accuses me everyday of cheating,  only thing I do is work and stay home. What am I doing wrong?"
relationships,Butt Touches,"I (22F) feel uncomfortable when my boyfriend (23M) grabs my ass. For a little while it was just in private which was totally fine. Like around the house, sometimes around friends. I've never been super comfortable with it but I put up with it for a while. 

Lately it's been getting more unbearable. He'll (nfsw) get up in there and massage it and it makes my insides squirm with discomfort and embarrassment.  I hate it! He'll smack it around friends all the time now. Always make sexual comments too. 

We had a huge fight about it (one of many usually smaller ones). He told me that he does it because it means I belong to him (and I can do it to him) and it's his way of showing affection. That I should stop being so conservative. He keeps trying to find a ""reason"" for why I hate it, but I don't think I need a reason.

Everytime I try to explain, ""it makes me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed"" ""I feel objectified"" ""It happens too much"" ""it's innappropriate"" he just doesn't get it and responds with ""you don't like when  I show you affection? Maybe you're too conservative. ""

Am I being unreasonable? Every time I try to give him the reason he wants he just fights it. Finding a reason and trying to tell me to be more understanding won't magically make me feel okay about it. Why doesn't he have to compromise? Why do I have to compromise about something that has to do with my own body? Everytime I bring up that it's my body, he argues that we share our bodies with each other when we're in a relationship. This really wasn't what I had in mind when I think of sharing myself with my partner. 

Any advice? Am I in the wrong?

TLDR: I am uncomfortable with him touching my butt as much as he does. He says it shows that he really likes me and refuses to stop."
relationships,My girlfriend (31) and I (27) are having a pause while I consider something she has made her mind up about,"On Sunday we met up for the first time in 2 and a bit months for a social isolation picnic.

Before Covid, we were discussing moving in together after having been in a 2 year relationship as of March.

At the picnic I asked her what we were going to do about this, and she confessed that during all this isolation she has decided that she enjoys her own company so much that she doesn't want to move in with anyone, or have anyone else move in with her.

She has now also changed her mind on wanting kids.

Realistically, I can live with the no kids thing, but the not living together (which she insists would be forever), comes off as very odd. Nevertheless, I also like my own company, but probably not to the extremity of only seeing her every 1 to 2 weekends (as we did before Covid). 

So basically her proposal is this:

* we continue as we are, but this will be forever
* we never get married 
* we never have kids
* we never live together 
* we remain boyfriend and girlfriend for the remainder of our lives and stay exclusive 


I've been noting down some Pros and Cons. 

**Pros:**

* My girlfriend is great. Smart, beautiful and fun
* I love her family 
* I love her home country
* Finances will be secure since we won't marry
* Get my own privacy
* No nagging
* Will eventually be bilingual
* No kids will mean more flexibility in life
* No kids will mean more money and therefore likely to lead to earlier retirement 
* Half the time I speak for the sake of it, because I like her to know that I'm thinking about her. Now I know she wants to be left in her own company for the majority of her time, I don't have to make small talk and ask her how her day is going and whether she slept well. 

**Cons:**

* Only see her 2-4 times a month
* No family of our own
* Sex drive will be crazy since there will be a lack of it
* Will require travel to see my partner
* Will have to be independent


I don't really know what I want to do in this situation. I love her very much, and she means a lot to me. Can someone please provide me with their thoughts on this scenario?

**Tl;Dr:** Girlfriend has come up with a very strange future plan and I am confused. What are your thoughts?"
relationships,Bro [23m] treats our sister [7f] way better than he ever treated me [16f] growing up. It hurts a bit to see.,"Growing up, my bro was more if a bully to me than a big brother. He would frequently bully me to tears, wouldn't do anything together with me, would shut off game consoles while I was playing so he would play, etc.

He's the complete opposite with our sister. When he comes back from work we generally give each other a ""sup"" or ""hello"" and that's it, but whe he sees her it's like ""OMG hellooooo, you are so beautiful, what have you done today, who did you talk to, what did you watch on TV, let's go to your room and do whatever you want the rest of the night"".

And then they'll play in her room and he basically worships everything she does.

So I'm a bit like ""seriously? You were an asshole all my childhood, I was basically scared of you the whole time and now you just flip a switch and treat her like a princess?"".

I want to clarify that I don't want him to treat her how like he treated me. I'd utterly karate chop him if I saw him bully her, but it still hurts that he had all this kindness and never showed it with me.

What should I do about all these feelings?

**tl;dr:** Bro treats our sister waaaay better than he ever treated me. Feels bad, man. What should I do about it?"
relationships,Boyfriend (31M) is uncomfortable having sex with me," 

This has been an off and on situation since November. We have been dating since October.

Basically he wasn't sure why his sex drive was so low (sex 1x every two weeks and maybe 1x a week). He guessed it was some combination of weight gain (we both gained 13-15 ish pounds but we are only slightly over weight), depression, being in a rut, etc. But nothing really changed.

Recently he said that it is totally psychological because he become's physically aroused but he just can't get his head into it. He told me that sometimes he will get horny enough to ""overcome"" his discomfort, like when we had sex last week but normally being uncomfortable wins out. This includes making out, oral sex, and penetrative sex. But he has no issue cuddling naked, taking showers together, giving me hugs or kissing my head/cheek throughout the day or saying sweet things like ""you are pretty"" or ""I love you."" So he isn't sure why he feels ""uncomfortable"" and says it has nothing to do with me. I guess this was also an issue in his last relationship but he always blamed his low sex drive on the fact that they were fighting a lot. We used to fight often but we've gotten a lot better at communication. We are both very affectionate and loving people.

I know he says its not about me, but it still feels like it is. My self esteem is suffering and I am getting more agitated. I usually get agitated when I am sexually frustrated. I have tried having him kiss and hold onto me while I finish myself but it didn't go well and hes offered t go down on me but I just can't get into it because I can tell he's not into it. Guilt takes over and I just can't finish.

After hearing him say he's uncomfortable, I find myself second guessing all physical contact with him and checking in all the time to see if he feels ok. Like I was just kissing him and paused to see if it felt ok. He said it did, but even though he was getting physically aroused he didn't want to progress it any further than kissing and returned to his video games.

I Just don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel ok or how to stop checking in all the time. I don't know how to help him get passed this. He says hes just as frustrated as me because he feels like hes failing and letting me down. He says he wants it to change. So far we agreed this week to do small intimate sexual things like kissing more to see if we can help him be comfortable again. But as I mentioned above, I just struggle with that now too. He currently agitated with me because I started talking about it again and getting upset and he just wants me to appreciate ""what I do have.""

So anyways, advice would be great or if anyone has overcome this I would love to hear about it. I am so scared we will break up over our different libidos and thats just awful because we normally have great chemistry.

tl;dr: Boyfriend is uncomfortable having sex with me and I don't know how to even approach him. Advice appreciated"
relationships,Bf (23M) seems to have lost interest towards me (20F) because of my sport,"Was recommended to post this here for help and advice... First off sorry for my bad English, am not a first native speaker - honestly not sure where to start on this: BF (23M) seems to have almost completely lost interest in me sexually (20F) in recent times. We have never had an amazing sex life but it was alright and that was okay to me, but it's just bad beyond bad now, IMO.

Background: we got together almost 2 years ago, I've always been doing sports, so have been on the more athletic/meaty side since forever (played waterpolo since high school and currently competing for my university). For the record when we first got together till now he's always slammed my sport background and regularly (teasingly) calls me and my teammates/friends names that aren't nice, just as we're more broad-shouldered/buff than the average person? Because he thinks that girls doing physical activities are unattractive and masculine. But other than these semi-jokes he's honestly been an extremely loving and caring boyfriend, which is great so I've somewhat grown to accept/tolerate the former things

Around 2-3 months into our relationship I got into a really bad place emotionally (partially because of his negative outspoken opinions on my sport and my body type but also because of other personal issues too making me enter a state of depression), and ended up kinda neglecting myself and doing bad things like binge-eating alot. Felt horrible and bloated all the time, and coupled with waterpolo and the pool making you very hungry I gained lots of weight, almost 15kg in a year and got very chubby lol. But during this whole time he was always unconditionally loving of me no matter how downtrodden I was/felt, and was always there for me! Which I really appreciated and will never forget

After that dark phase I decided that I really had to get out of my own horrible pit and start taking care of myself again, started taking my meds regularly and going back to practice and also training 6-7 days a week. 9 months through lost a ton of weight and put on a sizeable amount of lean mass relatively, like having kinda ""manly"" defined biceps and visible stomach muscles... because of that throughout this period even though he was sweet in other aspects, he got back to insulting our sport and me again, e.g. calling me ""gross"" for having muscular arms and a ""4-pack"" and I could feel our relationship deteriorating emotionally and sexually. He never initiates anything sexual anymore and is very unresponsive even when I try to, and nowadays during the rare times we get it on he almost makes disgusted faces when he sees my body (which is extremely extremely hurtful to me and my self-esteem), but also does mind-boggling things like touching/holding onto or caressing my shoulders/biceps and abs when we do actually end up making love...? Which is really weird and contrary to everything else

Our bedroom is pretty much dead right now and he doesn't want to talk about it, when I try to bring it up he's uncommunicative and just keeps going back to his opinion that I'm unfeminine now, which he brings up almost day-to-day whenever he's reminded of it. Today was the last straw when he outright said something like *""your revolting arm muscles are bulging and that's sickening""* when I was doing up my hair and changing while he was there waiting for me. He then walked out of the apartment. I'm alone now crying in the toilet as I'm typing this, I really love him a lot and want to salvage this relationship, and I know he loves me a lot too. I'm pretty much at a loss of what to do and really need help from anyone

TLDR: boyfriend finds me repulsive because of my sport, our sex life is dead but he refuses to communicate. **I would really want to try my best to repair and respark the fire in this relationship, would appreciate any and all advice**"
relationships,"I [27F] unknowingly dated a married man [31M] a couple months ago, he is now leaving his wife and wants to stay with me. I don't know if I want him to.","So before this whole covid thing happened I drunkenly hooked up with this guy and then we casually dated. I liked him, we had a fun time and he seemed pretty nice but then he admitted to me he was actually married. He gave the excuse of a bad marriage, no sex etc, he was drunk and hadn’t planned to do it (obvious lie as he planned ahead enough to remove his wedding ring,). Anyway, I didn’t seem him again and we didn’t talk again.


Then covid happened and we got a stay at home order. A couple weeks into it he messaged me to check how I was doing. Yes, I probably should have ignored him but I was bored and pretty lonely (I live alone) so we have been messaging since then. We talked quite a lot and he told me a lot more about his marriage, though I have no idea if he is lying or not but it did for real seem like he was struggling being locked in together.


Yesterday I got a call from him and he told me that he and his wife have agreed to separate and so he can’t stay with his wife anymore and he asked if he could stay with me? He said it would just be a short time until he got a place of his own but I was a “preferred option” because I live alone and have no kids or anything so it would be low risk. He also said he really likes me and thinks maybe we have something.


I just said I would think about it (he wants to come tomorrow). I do feel kind of sorry for him, it is a rough time for relationships but then I remember he cheated on his wife, which is a shit thing to do even if you’re marriage is dead. But then maybe I kinda led him on by messaging him through all this but I did never ask him to leave his wife or anything for me. I did/do like him but I don’t know if I want a relationship with him. It has all happened really quickly. But also, there’s a global pandemic and maybe I should be a nice person and let him stay for a couple days. Honestly, I would feel better about that if hadn’t said “maybe we have something”, because now I feel weird that he’s doing this because he likes me. Advice? Is it rude to say no?  I feel bad about saying no because even if I didn’t want to be, I am now involved in his breakup. 



---
**tl;dr**: I dated a married guy (I didn't know) a couple months ago. Now he is leaving with his wife and asked to stay with me (temporarily) but he also said he likes me. I don't really want to be involved but I am and feel bad about saying no."
relationships,I'm feeling insecure with the girl I'm dating when I didn't feel that way before.,"Basically when I (25M) first met this girl (26F) I was this confident guy who she was really into, not that she isn't into me now but for some reason my confidence has dropped after 2 months of dating. I'm constantly worrying about whether she's still into me or not, if she may be attracted to other guys, if she still finds me attractive, if she feels the same way as before, etc.

The first few weeks she was all cute and romantic and all, now she's still kind of cute with me but she has transitioned as more of a ""friendly"" kinda thing with romantic stuff too, she's playful, sometimes gets a little aggressive (in a fun respectful way of course), we kind of roast each other just for fun (again, respectfully). I don't know if that's because we've grown more together and she feels like she can trust me more, my guess is that she feels comfortable with me. I'm aware that your partner should be your best friend and you should treat yourselves as such, and usually this isn't an issue, and probably in this case it isn't either, but then I wouldn't know why I'm feeling so anxious about this going south if everything is working just fine. I don't know if it's going ""too good"" for it to be actually true...

She says she's really feeling something different when we're together, she says that as soon as I leave she starts to miss me and she gets emotional with the songs I tell her to listen to because they remind her of me, but for some reason I feel way too insecure now. This is the first time I feel this way, I'm usually pretty confident, but I don't know what's happening.

Is this normal? How do you cope with this?

TL;DR: After 2 months of dating a girl as a confident guy I'm starting to feel insecure and it's giving me anxiety, is this normal? How do you cope with this?"
relationships,My boyfriend (28M) is best friends with his parents. I (25F) want him to stop sharing so much info about me to them.,"Me and my BF have been together for 2 years now. Our relationship is great, i really don’t have much to say but good things about us as a couple. 

I know he has a great relationship with his parents. As an only child, they bond so well like the perfect family we all want to be a part of. I also know they call eacb other often and talk about everything. 

I didn’t really think much of it as an issue until recently that he told me that he shared to his parents how much I make. The number doesn’t matter at all, what was hurtful was him pointing out that it was a minimum wage salary. 

He didn’t realize this was a bad thing because he said he feels like we’re family (him, me and his parents).  I don’t feel the family aspect yet tho since we’re not yet married and I haven’t spent significant time with his parents to give a family kind of trust. 

But more than that, i just learned he also shares other problematic stuff about my family to his parents. My family isn’t as perfect as his, and we have issues. I’m not gonna list them down, but i would say there are troublesome ones.  

I’m just not sure how to approach. I don’t wanna break his relationship with his parents. But I also want a best friend out of him who I can talk freely about anything to and not find out that our conversations are getting passed to his parents. 

I’m all eyes and ears! 
Thank you! 

TLDR: BF tells his parent most of the things we talk about. Lately i found out he revealed my salary to them. I’m not comfortable with them knowing that yet. Also found out he shares my family issues with them. I don’t want them to be aware of that either. What’s the best way to approach this without hurting his relationship with his parents?"
relationships,"My (30f) husband (33m) starts community college this fall. He's never been a very driven student, and he's nervous about failing. How do I support him and help him succeed without veering into weird parent territory?","So I am thrilled that my husband has decided to give school another try. I suggested this years ago when we first got married, but he wasn't interested so I didn't push the issue. He had a few periods of unemployment this year, and finally last month he said he wants to get his BA. I'm so happy for him (and so bored having nothing to plan for since we're stuck inside), and I've really gone all in researching programs and mapping out a potential course schedule. I've asked him a few times if this bothers him, or if I'm overreaching (I think I might be), but he said he's grateful for the help because his parents didn't go to college, so he doesn't have any idea where to start.

We've always had different ideas about formal education. I love it. I was a huge nerd in hs, went to a great college, and I'm working towards my masters now. He's interested in formal education only when it's practical (aka, you need it for your job), and he doesn't make an effort when it's not. For example, he started college right after he graduated hs, but he dropped out halfway through his first year because he was able to get a good paying job. He's never had issues with employment until now, which is why he's decided to try college again.

So here's where I really need some advice. He's just started some summer classes (gen ed stuff, not related to his chosen major), and I'm really involved in his coursework right now. I mapped out his assignments on a calendar, read all the syllabi, dictated some emails to professors, and I keep nagging him about his homework. He asked me this morning if this is how I'll be when we have kids and they start school, and I'm horrified. My parents weren't like this at all with me, but have I accidentally turned into a helicopter parent for my husband (gross)? He said he appreciates the help, but I can't tell if 1.he's being polite or 2.he likes it because I'm doing some the organizing that he should be learning to do. I want to help him succeed, but I don't want to do the work for him. I definitely don't want to be like this when we have kids.

TL;DR My husband just started college classes, and asked me if I'm going to be as involved with our future children's education as I am with his. I've mapped out a course schedule for him, and I'm following along with all his classes. I want him to succeed. Help me. Should I back the hell off?"
relationships,How do I gently tell my bf to lower his expectations?,"I (27 F) started seeing my bf (28 M) about six months ago. I needed to take things slowly, and he was very understanding of that. We decided to ""officially"" become a couple about a week ago. Really, all that changed was that we would start introducing each other as bf/gf to other people instead of referring to each other as ""the guy/girl I've been seeing.""

Since we became ""official,"" he's been... a bit different. I'm not a particularly affectionate person. I've been likened to a house cat in that I want affection when I want it, but when I don't, I *really* don't. He's an extremely affectionate person, but has tried very hard to give me space. In return, I try to be more physically affectionate than what generally comes naturally to me.

Since our conversation regarding our relationship status, though, he's been *much* more affectionate and less cognisant of me needing space. He's pushed the ""L-word"" on me a few times, saying that I don't have to tell him that I love him, he can see it in my actions. But I don't love him. I'm not at that point yet. I care about him a lot, and obviously want to keep him around, but I feel like, since we became an official couple, he's moving at warp speed. I still need to go slowly. When he said that, I told him that I need him to understand that, even though we've moved forward in our relationship, that doesn't mean that I automatically love him. (I said it nicer than that in the conversation, but I can't remember the exact wording.)

He's always been quite needy, but in the past week, he's been calling me all the time (even when he knows I'm having a rare, socially-distant visit with my family), he's assumed that I'm going to be staying with him all the time even though I have an apartment that I pay to live in, and has been dropping the L-Bomb. How do I tell him as gently as possible that I still need to take things slowly and that I'm starting to feel smothered?

TL;DR — A week after becoming an ""official"" couple, my bf is being very needy and is starting to drop L-Bombs. How do I very gently tell him that I'm not in the same place and that he should lower his expectations?"
relationships,My SO is no longer abusive; I feel like I'm scarred,"Tl;dr: I can't relax even though my formerly toxic relationship is now healthy

I (28M) have been with my partner (27F) for 3 years. My partner was verbally, emotionally and physically abusive for the first two years and eventually decided she wanted to change and not lose me. She has changed, she's pretty much a different person and is treating me much better and catching herself when the toxic behaviors try to surface.

Here's the problem: I am constantly having memories of the bad times. It feels like I'm constantly on high alert for the switch to flip and everything to go bad again. I only experience flashbacks in very specific scenarios; the rest of the time, I just can't relax.

Does this stop? Will time heal?"
relationships,How long to wait for I love you?,"I (female 24) told my boyfriend (male 25) that I loved him about three months ago now and he hasn't said it back. When I told him he said it was too early and he didn't want to say it until he knew for sure. I respected that and told him I wouldn't be waiting for it.  
So we have been officially dating six months but sleeping together for ten. I fall in love hard and fast and I'm very expressive in nature. I tell myself he probably will say it and I /know/ that rushing him or pressuring him is not the answer but I am starting to understand that at some point I will probably have a cut off time.  
I don't feel like anyone should put a timer on anything when it comes to relationships but I want the real deal and the longer I wait and get my hopes up the harder I fall.  
Right now I feel really upset, I'm just worked up over it. I really love him and I just want it to work out, I think it will but I'm starting to doubt it.  
One of my friends waited a whole year for her boyfriend to say I love you. She is very mature and patient and they have a wonderfull relationship.  
I guess I'm just scared, I'm not sure I can wait that long? I don't know.  
Why can't everything be perfect right? haha

relationships,My (23F) boyfriend (23M) never wants to leave the bedroom,"I’m realizing that the title comes off as sexual, but that’s not what I’m talking about haha.

We live in a fairly hot climate (May-October has consistent days above 85 fahrenheit and even hotter in summer months) with my boyfriend’s dad. They won’t run the central air unless it reaches 85 in the living room (the coolest room in the house) despite the fact that I’ve offered to help with the energy bill. 

My boyfriend is very anxious around his father and doesn’t like to spend time in the condo’s living spaces or to leave the bedroom door open (even though he owns a third of it and his dad has emphasized that we are welcome to hang out in common areas). 

The bedroom gets to 10 degrees Fahrenheit more than the temperature outside because of the sun beating down on our side of the building and the lack of air flow. 

It gets so hot that we’re drenched in sweat from 11am-6pm. Any time I ask to open the door or to go hang out downstairs, he gets anxious and sometimes even angry with me. 

How do I (1) convince him that these aren’t appropriate living conditions and (2) help him with his anxiety about hanging around his dad. We’re not moving out any time soon due to financial reasons. (That’s probably a little over a year down the road when we both finish with school).

tl;dr: My bf’s too anxious to spend time in the common areas of the house, but the bedroom gets between 85-100 degrees every day from 11-6."
relationships,Boyfriend (29/m) got fired because he was trying to be like my (31/f) ex!,"My boyfriend just lost his job because he was trying so hard to be like my ex!

It is very upsetting to me! 

A few months ago, my boyfriend learned that my ex was able to provide a fairly lavish lifestyle for us. It was hard to explain what my ex did for a living.

My ex was basically a con artist. He’d go work for business then eventually pressure people in high position into a horrible deal. Gradually he’d just push them until they basically pay up his contract or pay him to leave.  But my ex come from a family of attorneys and knows tons of people in high position. That’s how he was able to make this work.

My boyfriend doesn’t have any of that! He stupidly assumed he found a way. He tried it and got fired for it!

I’m so angry! One thing I love about my boyfriend is, he was the type of man who always take on extra works, will stay late, is first in and last out, very willing to pull his shirt off and jump into the ditch right away.

I don’t want to be with someone who cheat, steal, and backstabbing others even if it is to my profit!

My boyfriend is extremely worried that I want what my ex was able to provide. He also have been saying things like it must be nice to be paid so much to quit and all that! It is pissing me off!

This isn’t kind of man I want to be with!

Tldr; my boyfriend thinks he’s not good enough for me. Tried to be like my ex and now got ourselves even deeper in the hole!"
relationships,How do I (31 f) stop wanting to find someone who cares about me enough to marry me?,"It’s a very stupid thing- but I’ve always wanted to get married and have that commitment to someone. 
This obviously hasn’t happened since I am here. 

I don’t need the relationship as a crutch. I’m actually pretty good at being alone and using my friends as a support network. 

I think I communicate decently in relationships and have been told I do in the past, but at the end of the day no one wants to actually commit to me in the manner I wild like. So I would love to stop wanting it. 

Any advice on how to? I’m just so insanely tired of the never ending disappointment. 

TLDR: I want to be married, no one wants to marry me. How do I stop wanting to be married?"
relationships,Girlfriend of 2.5 years randomly stopped talking to me,"Girlfriend randomly stopped talking to me

Hey, kinda new here, so a few days ago my girlfriend of 2.5 years, randomly stopped talking to me. I have no idea why, it started Last Friday night but I’ll give a little backstory. So me and her have had a very healthy relationship, very little arguing or fighting, we always got along and it was a match made in heaven. We clicked since high school and she my was my girlfriend throughout my senior year and just recently herself graduated, she’s 18 and I’m 21 btw. so we always talked about staying together and moving in you know the usual love story made to be. But we have had our ups and downs. now maybe 2 years into the relationship we did break up or took a break, however you want to call it, when it happened she did the same thing she did to me now ( I’ll explain in a few ) it was very sudden and long story short she told me that she “ wanted to find herself “. We eventually got back together and made up and you know the usual everything went well. Fast forward to now and it was a normal Friday, we planned to hangout as it was my off day and she goes into work at 5, so I woke up early went to her house and it was a normal great day, we went out ate and had a good time, around 4:30 I have her a hug and kiss goodbye and she went to work and I went home. Now usually when she gets off she’ll text me and we’ll video chat for a little bit till she or me falls Asleep. Well come around to 10 ( the time she gets off ) and she doesn’t text or call or anything. We have the life 360 app ( she made me download it ) and it told me she got home, so I attempted to call her but to no remorse, she didn’t answer my texts or calls anything. I thought okay ? Maybe she fell asleep, it’s happened before, long day at work, Well I assumed everything was well and went to bed. I had work at 8am so I woke up texted her good morning and went to work, she usually wakes up around 11-1ish and tells me good afternoon, well...... nothing the whole day she didn’t text me I tried calling her texting, texting her nothing was working. I didn’t worry a bit until she started opening the messages and leaving me on read without responding, well that Saturday she had work again and went into work at 5 and posted on her Snapchat story and I knew something was up, ( she’s still been ignoring my calls and texts since I woke up at 8 btw ). So come around 9:17 to be exact I check on life 360 and my heart sank a little she turned off her location so I couldn’t see anymore. And then... we’ll I checked instagram and she took me off her instagram bio and took all our pictures down. I was so confused and had no idea what was going on. So I had no idea what she was doing that night but again I texted her around her get off time ( 10pm) and again ignored my calls and texts. Fast forward to Sunday and again same thing, ignoring my calls and texts and now today it’s the same, I just wish she could tell me what’s going on I just don’t understand, after 2.5 years together I figure it wouldn’t be hard to tell me how she felt but I’m left in the dark. 
TL;DR I need a second opinion on what you guys think, because I’m completely confused on what’s going on."
relationships,Boyfriend [22M] uncomfortable with me [23F] living with male friend [28M],"We'd be living in a 3 bed/2 bath house with one other girl. My boyfriend (Henry) says he's uncomfortable with me living with a male friend (Frank) because all the female/male friend roommate duos he has known have ended up sleeping together. Henry asked me how I would feel if a female friend of his moved in with him. Honestly, I'd be fine with it because I trust him! Henry says he trusts me, it's Frank, and all other guys, he doesn't trust. The thing is, Frank is one of the nicest, least-threatening guys I know. Frank is the last person to come in between a relationship; he likes Henry a lot! I get the feeling Henry is upset because he asked me to move in with him, but I said no because we'd only be dating 7 months by then. So in his mind I'm choosing another man over him.

Henry says it's ultimately my choice. But I don't want to be uncomfortable every time Henry comes over, knowing that he is suspicious of Frank. Do I go ahead and move in with Frank and the other girl? Or do I take Henry's feelings into account and not do it?

TL;DR!: Seems short enough to me."
relationships,My Parents are Giving my Girlfriend (F18) and me (M19) an Ultimatum: Us or Them—Need Urgent Help.,"I’ll try to be concise but there's a lot to consider (sorry). Currently we’ve been dating for a year and a half.

Growing up in Austin I was in a very controlling house. My parents heavily monitored what I did on my phone, whether it was who I called or what messages I sent, among a lot more things. It was difficult to hang out with people because I was given harsh time slots—if I didn’t make it back in time my phone would be taken for weeks and I would be unable to go out again for months. 

Fast forward to a year ago, I started dating a girl who was still in high school a while before I left for college. My parents thought that I would not continue it as a long-distance relationship. Yet, we stayed together, talking on the phone every day for long periods of time. Between school, an intense club I was a part of, and my not-super-social nature, I did not leave my room much to socialize so I could focus on homework. When my parents found out about this, they were furious. They blamed her occupation of my time talking for my lack of sleep and social interactions during my first year in college, when I was supposed to explore the social scene the most. My gf and I addressed this issue and have since cut back on how much we talk and no longer sacrifice sleep. My social circle still did not expand at school, and I did notfault her for it, though my parents still did. Additionally, when I was back on break, I spent more time with her than I did with my family, which further infuriated them to the point that they began to control how often I saw her. This made me upset, as I wanted to spend a lot of time with the one I was in love with—being long distance, it was already really hard.

By the time the next break came around, my parents heavily restricted the times I could see my girlfriend. Because of this, I lied to my parents about when I was seeing her. My parents found out about these lies and, again, were furious.

By this time, they also claimed to have figured out the type of person my girlfriend was. She was going through tough times in the fall that made her question a lot of what her path in life looked like and caused a lot of changes to occur within a short amount of time regarding what she wanted to do with her future. Citing her inability to have a consistent future plan, the possibility of her to go through another time like this again, and the lack of sleep and social life they *believed* she was causing me, they told me to break up with her. Knowing that my parents never had a full conversation with my girlfriend (and thus did not truly know her, but thought they did through assumptions of people of her “type”), I didn’t agree with them. She wasn’t affecting my performance at school, I’m generally more reserved (smaller circle of friends), and I still stayed awake in all my classes and got a very high GPA (4.0). Despite this, to please my parents, I listened and broke up with her—but it only for six hours until I called her while I was on my way back to college because I’m in love with her and I really did not want her out of my life.

One of the biggest concerns my parents have is my girlfriend’s mental health. During her confusing time, one of her good friends committed suicide which caused her to spiral. Although she was in a depressive state with scary thoughts, on her own volition she found help in the form of a therapist, found coping strategies, and ultimately pulled herself out of the slump with no harm done. To this my parents told me that if this depressive state happened once, it can easily happen again and could possibly be worse and therefore it is a red flag, as it had happened once before, but got considerably better at handling it the second time. I think that my girlfriend did amazingly well in the tough time, but my parents thoroughly believe it will be a recurring problem.

In the summer when I was back for a long amount of time, I started trying to see her again. But my parents continued to resist, telling me to break up with her, to explore more of what college has to offer instead of being in my room all the time. I am naturally not as social so I didn’t see it as problematic as they did, but I’m confused if it’s actually a problem. My gf and I have tried to accommodate their complaints without having to break up. My parents, however, do not want to listen to what I have to say or try to understand my viewpoint—my mom even stopped talking to me for casual conversation for more than a month. Sometimes, they say they want to talk, but whenever we try to, it's them talking TO me, leaving no space for me to explain my side. When I finally do get to put a word in, they don’t seem like they even try to understand, and I feel like they’re so stuck in their ways: they will only stop when I break up with her. Even if my gf and I try to provide compromises to resolve some issues without having to break up, they do not think they will work. Because of my unwillingness to break up, they have resorted to an ultimatum: either my family or my girlfriend. I am confused on whether the red flags they see my gf has (particularly her mental health) are legitimate or not, as she treats me very well, makes me happy, and I’m in love with her. I’m also confused whether the problems they bring up are actually the problem or if it’s something else because when we have a solution, they still don’t like it. I am a legal adult, am financially independent, and have a safe place to go, so that is not an issue for me. Thoughts? I feel so lost :/ I don’t want to lose either of them.

TL;DR My parents have a problem with my girlfriend, claims she has red flags which are questionable, and is forcing me to choose between them or her."
relationships,Is masturbation ok in a marriage?,"Me (24) and my gf (22) are having a disagreement about whether a person should masturbate if they are in a fulfilling relationship and if the other partner has a right to be unhappy about it.
She says if you're having sex there should be no reason to ever need to and you should just wait if their not in the mood
I say if your horny and your partner isnt in the mood then there should be no reason not to handle your own buisness in a way that hurts nobody.

What do you think? More details on request.

Tl;dr gf thinks that married men shouldn't masturbate and I think shes being unreasonable

EDIT: so I broke it down exactly what the issue was and she says ""do what you want"" I'm sad she seems upset about it but better now that 10 years from now. Normally I'll flex with her but I had to put my foot down today. Hopefully she comes around because I  care about her alot but she has some things she needs to work put for herself that I cant help her with😤😩"
relationships,I’m jealous of my (21F) boyfriends (22M) relationship with his twin sister. And he’s not understanding or helping.,"Pretty much exactly what I said. His sister and I don’t NOT get along, but there has been miscommunication on things and I don’t agree with all of the things she has done and some of the things made me upset while we were hanging out. If I’m in the wrong, he will straight up defend her side. But if she’s in the wrong, he’ll roll it off like it’s not a big deal or come up with “alternatives” to avoid sticking up for me. It’s annoyingly and irritating. I addressed it to him on Friday and he said he’ll work on it but may take time. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard? I get she’s your twin. But you shouldn’t treat us differently when it comes to that. I understand and I’m not trying to replace her. 

The most recent example happened over the last week. This past Friday the two of us and his sister and her boyfriend all got hibatchi takeout. I only asked for two things, and I didn’t think it was a lot to ask for. I asked that we eat outside and that we take separate cars because of Covid-19. My grandfather passed with it so I’ve been really nervous about it and I didn’t think it was a lot to ask for. So my boyfriend said no problem and told her. She IMMEDIATELY texted me and was like “wouldn’t it be better if we take one car because of gas. And don’t worry no one else will be home it will just be us”. I got a little upset because I took that as she was trying to get her way. It also upset me because she only texts me when it’s convenient for her. I text her all the time about stuff and she never replies. I mentioned this to my boyfriend and all he did was say “she just wants to make you comfortable.” Which I can see, but he was totally ignoring my side. We literally went back and forth on this for 3 days. Thursday he tells her that we’re going in 2 cars and she’s like “well i wanted to go in one so we can hangout and listen to music and talk”. And I’m just like “you literally have been defending her for 3 days when i have been saying she just wanted to get her way and she pretty much just admitted to that.” Then Friday comes, and he tells me that we will meet them at the house and she will already have the food there. We get there and she’s like, “I didn’t get the chance to order the food yet”. This immediately annoys me because I felt like she did that on purpose to get her way. So my boyfriend asks if we can wait at the house and she’s like “preferably not”. So obviously she just wanted it all to go her way?? I thought i was nice enough just to even go to the house. So my boyfriend is like to me “I’ll let you decide what to do”. Instead of sticking up for me. 

Maybe I’m overreacting but so many little things added up into one large thing and it’s soooo frustrating. He tells me I’m his #1 but he doesn’t always treat me like it. I have a past where I was always made feel like I was less important than someone else, even to my own father. My dad left my family and to this day he takes care of and pays more attention to his step daughter than he even talks to me. My past with my dad intensifies my feelings of feeling unimportant and replaceable. I understand, twins have an unimaginable bond. I wouldn’t want their bond to change. However, I want how he treats us so differently in defense to change. Am I asking for too much? Every time I ask he says he’ll “work on it”. I just don’t know why it’s so hard to stick up for me but he has no problem doing it for her. We’ve been together for over a year. We have talked about getting married, moving in, and having kids in the future. But I don’t want to if this doesn’t change. They can’t rely on each other forever. I appreciate honest feedback, thanks.

TL;DR: I’m jealous and annoyed with my boyfriend and his twin sisters relationship. He constantly defends his twin sister even if she’s in the wrong and there’s proof she’s in the wrong. It’s so irritating and I just want him to have my back the way he has hers. I understand twins have a special bond, but I need help."
relationships,Any advice for relationship anxiety?,"TLDR: I’ve suffered from relationship anxiety my whole life. Currently dating someone new a few months in, falling for him but really worried it’s going to end soon, or that I’m so anxious about it ending I’ll manifest it. 

Sorry if this is long! :( I’ve (26f) suffered anxiety my whole life and on/off the past 10 years I’ve gone to try and get help. It definitely gets worse when I’m dating someone and I start to lose control of the situation. Not knowing what’s going to happen and how the other person truly feels kills me. 

I’ve recently started seeing someone (32m) and he’s amazing. He’s the first guy I’ve been able to talk to kinda freely and so far we have great communication, and I think he understands that I’m an anxious person. He’s very sweet and has told me how he feels. We’ve had a few moments recently where I’ve gotten upset and we’ve talked it through and he’s helped me. But now I’m just being paranoid and questioning every little thing he does or doesn’t do (in my head), and I’m so worried it’s going to end. I can’t calm down about it or stop thinking about the relationship. It feels too good to be true, and I’m so worried it’s not true. 

I really, really like this guy. I think for the first time in my life it could be something, he’s different to other guys I’ve dated. It’s gotten to the point now though where my other relationships have ended, and I’m scared that this is going to go the same way. That he’s suddenly going to ghost me or change his mind like the others. Or that he’s just lying to me about everything. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to manage this? Whilst being in lockdown I don’t have my normal methods of easing my anxiety, so I’m struggling more than normal. I’m going to try and see my therapist for help but would love to know I’m not alone in this in the meantime."
relationships,TL;DR Partner not attracted to me because of weight gain.,"I’m new to reddit but I’m really looking for advice. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years (I’m 22F hes 28M) and when we first met I was in the best physical shape of my life. Once i met him I picked up his bad eating habits and gained a lot f weight. Since then he hasn’t wanted to have sex often and after I broke up with him because of it he finally admitted that his low sex drive was because i had gained weight. He said he still loves me and thinks I’m beautiful but that he wants for us to both get back into shape to help his sex drive.

Ive always wanted to get back into shape, however i am embarrassed and insecure about the truth of him not being attracted to me at this weight. I guess I’m looking for advice to see if this makes him a bad person or not(or if his lack of attraction is fair)? I understand that we are allowed to be attracted to certain things. Ive never been in the situation where my partners body changed significantly/or to something I’m not attracted to.

And i know that our relationship isn’t just about how i look (he didnt want to break up in the first place because he still loves me as a person). If it is fair that he isn’t attracted to me at this weight and we can work on it together, how can i still feel sexy/beautiful during the process of losing weight? Like i said, Ive always wanted to lose the weight and would be doing this for myself as well.

TL;DR"
relationships,"My girlfriend (F25) broke up with me (F25) because she didn't feel like a priority. Now I'm in quarantine by myself, unsure how to move ahead.","I am from the US, but we live in Peru and my now-ex is Peruvian. In typical queer-girl fashion, things got super serious super fast. She was (and still is) smart, passionate, open-minded, and thoughtful. I was the first girl she had ever been with (she’s bi), and she told me that being with me helped her to accept things about herself that she never had before. When we first became an official couple, she made it clear that her coming out to her homophobic mother was not a possibility, at least for a long time. I understood and knew that she needed to wait to come out until she was ready.

The toll of being in the closet was really tough on her and she felt insecure about the relationship in general. I went to visit my brother, who I only see about four weeks per year, and my girlfriend and I often fought about me going a little AWOL via text, as I would sometimes not respond at all during a dinner with my brother and it made her feel terrible.  Nine months into our relationship, her mom sneakily logged into her Whatsapp and read the messages between us and learned that we were a couple, not friends as we had explained to her. Her mom told her to choose between living under her roof or me. She chose me and moved out.

When she moved out, she was super excited for me to come over to her new place a lot. Even though she basically “fell out” of the closet (came out involuntarily) she had a new sense of freedom and some weight lifted off her shoulders, as her mother had not literally “killed her” as she had feared. I don’t have a car, so I would take a 20-minute taxi ride to see her. She has a motorcycle, so she went to my place a lot more frequently than I went to hers, which made her feel unloved.

This past year, I have been a first-year teacher so I’m super stressed and overwhelmed with all the work that I need to do, in addition to managing a difficult classroom of fourth graders. This took a huge toll on our relationship as I would be super tired when I got home, I would be super tired and not totally present. I also didn’t cook for her or do romantic things as much as I used to at the beginning of our relationship. Sometimes, my coworkers would invite me for a beer after work and I would happily go, but then my girlfriend would be upset that I didn’t let her know I was going, even though the get-togethers were totally spontaneous.

When I visited my family over Christmas break, my uncle (I was very close to him), suddenly had a stroke and we spent almost two weeks in the hospital before he died. Days after, I flew back to keep working without fully processing what had happened. Two and a half months later, quarantine started. My girlfriend came to stay with me and we had a wonderful ten days together. But I started to feel super homesick and decided that I needed to go home via a small plane carrying out diplomatic flights, fully intending to come back to Peru after two months or so. I bought some tickets and even though she was clearly sad about it, she helped me with some logistics in going home. Again, she was very disappointed because she had planned to spend at least two months with me in quarantine. She went back to her place. Then, I decided not to go home, (1) because I was terrified to fly at a time like this and maybe make my family sick and perhaps have more deaths in the family, and (2) because I was excited to spend more time with her.

I called her and told her I was going to stay in Peru, and she wasn’t as excited as I had hoped. She had been so excited to spend this time, and I had chosen to go home not knowing when I would be allowed to re-enter Peru due to travel restrictions (even though I ultimately didn’t go back to the US). She said that she had planned to break up with me when I got home to the US. We didn’t speak for two weeks before she called me asking what I would do to make her more of a priority in her life. I honestly didn’t know how to respond because I didn’t even know if we were still in a relationship. Then she found out through a friend that I had turned down another opportunity to go home. She was curious about this so she called me and asked why I didn’t go home this second time. I told her I wanted to be with her and see her, so I went over to her house and spent four days with her. It was amazing and felt like old times, and then I returned to my apartment, excited about our relationship again.

A few days after though, she sent me a message saying she felt weird about the four days we had just spent together. We met up two days ago and she told me she needed to talk to me. She said that despite the fun we had last week, we cannot be together anymore because it is clear we see relationships differently and she doesn’t see herself moving in with me or having our relationship progress any further. She was very hurt that I wanted to go home to my family even though she had chosen me over living with her family. So we are over. And I’m by myself in quarantine with no way to do the typical “post-breakup” activities that could help me move on. Now, I'm wondering how to move ahead. How does one balance family, friends, AND a relationship? I think that I probably suck at it. Oh, and there’s a balloon she gave me on Valentine’s Day in my house that says “I love being by your side” that I need to get rid of.

P.S. I’m sorry for the extremely long post. Nobody is obligated to read it all. But it did give me some clarity writing everything out. As for what is clearer, I’m not 100% sure. Though I do feel a bit better. Any and all thoughts are totally welcome.

TL;DR Various life events made me not able to be the best girlfriend I can be (but I do think that I could have handled some things better, regardless of my situation). My girlfriend of almost two years broke up with me because she felt that we were not on the same page and want different things out of a relationship. Now I’m newly single and quarantined by myself. Feels bad, man."
relationships,My [23F] boyfriend [23M] won’t stop playing video games,"
My bf and I have been together for 2 years and we recently officially moved in together due to covid. This feels like a very cliche issue to be having but it’s really creating a rift.

He’s always been into video games which I’m fine with. It’s a hobby and it’s something he gets to do with friends of his that live far away. I usually don’t have a problem with the gaming until we moved in together. Since quarantine he’s started to do nothing but play all day. He recently graduated and was meant to have been applying to jobs but he doesn’t seem to take it that seriously and instead spends like an hour applying to jobs one day a week and 9+ everyday playing video games. 

I’m all for people having their interests but we spend almost no quality time together. He is constantly tethered to the computer and “can’t” leave because he’s playing with other people. So many things have fallen to the wayside because his only focus is playing games. The computer he plays on is also in our bedroom so I can’t even go to sleep when I want because the lights from the screen are in my face and he’s talking on his headset. And no, there’s no where else to put it in the apartment.

I’ve brought this issue up with him and he acknowledges there’s a problem but does nothing about it. It’s honestly like he’s addicted to it. He has had some problems with depression and motivation which I assume has something to do with it but he doesn’t like to talk about it and isn’t proactive about his mental health. 

I really don’t know what to do about it at this point. I feel like I’ve tried so many different things and end up just feeling like his mother and nagging him to get off the computer. 

Advice?

TLDR: my bf won’t stop playing video games."
relationships,"Depressed (but medicated), unemployed husband (M~40) talks down on me (F~33) about trivial matters and won't do anything at all to improve our situation.","TLDR: I work from home, DH is unemployed due to being depressed (I am too, but not to the same degree). Due to covid cutting back my hours, we had to ask for help from our parents in order to make rent and buy groceries this month. When I started making the groceries list this morning, he had an attitude with me about buying too many snacks which I didn't appreciate. It just isn't true; the snack ratio last time was 10% of the entire bill, and they were not just for me.

Hello, throwaway for privacy reasons. My depressed husband is treating me unfairly, and although I do my best to support us, he just games all day long and expects things to get handed to him.

It's been almost 2 years since he quit his job due to 'too much pressure', it took us a year to get him into therapy, and now he's being treated for it for \~6 months. Even though he says he feels better (which is great), it feels like pulling teeth to get him to do ANYTHING around the house.

It's all fallen to my lap; I take care of all the bills, the budgeting, the work, the cooking, and he just puts the plates in the dishwasher when he remembers, and games all day long (hey, I do too, but I also take care of my other responsibilities, or at least try to). 

This month, I could not make it due to my hours being cut (because many of my clients temporarily closed down), and we had to ask our parents for some help. It irks me, but he just doesn't seem to really care. He had an attitude this morning, concerning my grocery list that I would pay for with some money from his mom... He told me (talking down at me, as if I was a kid) that I could go ahead with my list, provided I didn't buy any snacks at all. As if I am a big spender-as if I COULD be a big spender, even if I wanted to!

I mean, come on. It was a pack of cereal for breakfast (for both of us, which we sometimes eat for dinner therefore saving money), and some bread sticks (as a treat). You do nothing in this house, and you get an attitude if I want to spend $6.00 for snacks that we BOTH eat, just because it was your mom's money that paid for it this time? Ideally it would be OUR money, but shit happens! How hypocritical can you be? 

I calmly told him that I didn't appreciate being talked to like that, asked him not to shout at me, and said that he could keep his mother's money. I felt like a jerk because even though he started shouting at me, he then got really quiet, which makes me wonder whether I am partly the cause of his depression.

How long before I feel like I am with someone I can rely on again, someone who treats me like an equal partner, who doesn't wanna behave like a teenager that has to be nagged at for everything, and also to be able to talk down on me as if they have some authority over me? The doctor said sometimes it takes a year of medication to get back to normal. Is that true? 

It's getting real tiresome, I'm ok when he treats me ok, but when he does stuff like that, I feel so done with it all... Has anyone's depressed partner gotten back to normal, and if yes, how long did it take them to get healthy again?"
relationships,Should I (F23) see him (26M) again? Urgent.,"I need urgent help.

My ex boyfriend left me thrice and this last time came apologizing and said that he loves me and wants to see me one last time, I told everything he did to me and he was very upset but he doesn't say things like I will fix myself and I want to be with you etc, he accepts that he loves me and is sad that he hurt me but he doesn't initiate anything other than saying that we should meet one last time. He doesn't seem like he wants to get back together or wants to fix his toxic traits (as he abused me psychologically again and again) but is just uncertain all the time. I can't trust him anymore, and I thought that I had forgotten him, but I still feel excited and one part of me wants to meet him. What should I do?

TL;DR! My ex wants to meet with me one last time and wants me to forgive him in a way but doesn't directly say that he wants me back or he will change."
relationships,My family [mostly 40’s and 50’s] rented a beach house next week in a remote beach town. I can’t decide if me [26F] and my boyfriend [28M] should go?,"Backstory: My uncle surprised my family on Sunday saying he rented this oceanfront house in a remote beach town for next week. It’s a massive house with a pool, 10 bedrooms, fenced yard, etc. There is a lot of space. We’d get our own King room, it has a private beach area, lots of lounge space, you get the idea.

All of my aunts and uncles live in the Midwest about 30 minutes from the main city. Their county has had 5 cases. I, on the other hand, live next to NYC in Hoboken. Hoboken has 563 cases as of May 26th. Not a lot, but also not a little.

I am so conflicted. My boyfriend and I want to go obviously, but I am concerned about the safety and health of my family. Since they all agreed to go, it seems like they aren’t worried. My boyfriend and I are though. While we’ve both practiced social distancing, show no symptoms, and overall are healthy, I’m worried that we could have it and give it to my family or they could give it to us.

Is there any way to make this safe? Yes, the house is huge, but my boyfriend brought up good points that 1) We’d all be eating together, 2) We’re all hanging out inside and 3) Who knows if someone would contract it when driving down. There are just so many unpredictable things. He and I are the only ones who haven’t confirmed we’ve going. The total number of people in my family going is 12. This all really sucks, my heart says one thing but my head says another.

Please keep comments as polite as possible. I understand people may strong opinions about this subject, and disagree with my family’s decision to rent this house, but this is why I’m asking for advice here. 

Thanks in advance for any help. 

TL;DR: Family rented massive oceanfront house next week. Boyfriend and I want to go but I’m worried about our and my family’s safety and health. Should we go if we can practice social distancing somehow?"
relationships,My [29f] husband [32M] does not appreciate the things I do to make our home nice and I’m starting to become very frustrated.,"We bought a home last year and my husband is a very frugal person, so our home has looked kind of bare since. We got stimulus checks and since we have a little extra money, he agreed he would be ok with me buying curtains for the house. We don’t have curtains in any rooms except for one and it’s something I’ve been wanting for a long time.

Initially I was going to buy them online and showed him the price, which he was fine with. I found out today while he was at work that I could go get them from Big Lots for a cheaper price, so I did. While there I also got a piece of art for $40 since the walls in our bedroom are completely bare. Even with the art, I ended up spending about $20 less total than I would have spent buying just the curtains online. 

I spend all afternoon hanging these curtains and this art. It took a long time because we don’t have a drill (something else he doesn’t think we should spend money on), so I did everything by hand with my screwdriver, but I was happy with the way it looked and couldn’t wait for him to get home to see it. 

When he finally got home, he went into the bedroom but didn’t say anything about it. I asked him what he thought since he was being so quiet and he said “I mean, it looks good, I’m just surprised that money was spent on art.” I showed him our online banking statement and that I still spent less than originally planned, but he didn’t really have anything else to say. 

I’m pretty crestfallen. 

My back hurts and I spent my entire afternoon of my day off trying to make our house look nice and stayed within a $ amount he said he was ok with. Everything that has been brought into our house to make it look nice has come from my efforts. I put up these curtains, I’ve put up every one of the very few pieces of art we own. I picked out the furniture, the dishes. When something breaks like the toilet or a doorknob I’m the one that gets the tools out and gets on YouTube and figures out how to fix it.

I don’t know how to convey to him that I don’t feel appreciated, and honestly I’m starting to resent him for it. I’ve said the words “it hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that” yet this keeps happening. I don’t even need to be praised, but if he could just not shit on something after I’ve worked on it like saying the art I bought and put up was a waste of money, I would be so much happier.

Am I overreacting? If not, how can I bring this back up in a way that will make him understand that he’s hurting my feelings? It feels like if things were up to him we’d just live in an empty house with a futon on the floor and he’d like it better that way.

TL;DR: Husband makes no efforts to do anything to help our home look nice or well-maintained, yet only has negative things to say about my efforts. Why is he like this and how can I make him stop?"
relationships,Gut feeling about girlfriend. Hiding her actual name for almost a year. Need advice,"
TL;DR It feels like my gf doesn’t tell me something. Is it she or my insecurity. Really need some advice 

Sorry for possible mistakes, English is not my native language. 

Me (17M) and my girlfriend (21F), let’s name her Jane,  met on the internet over a year ago living in different cities. We started as friends and became a couple last May. She moved to my city 3 months ago and we started to live together. 
The first thing I want to say is that she changed her actual name and surname to those that i know 3 months ago, and I’ve found it out a month ago. I’ll give more detail later in the text.

Some background:
So Jane is a communicative type of person that likes to chat with people and help them. She’s an ordinary girl in terms of social interactions, but in her teens she was quite shy and awkward. I mention this because she had no relationships or physical contact with other guys before me. It was kind of difficult to believe, but we both agree that there is no reason to tell something like that if it’s not true. She is also my first girlfriend. 

At the start of our relationship the main issue was Jane’s communication with other people. The thing is while we were friends I thought we were really good ones, but in fact there were a lot of people she chatted with just like with me. And it’s not about me being jealous, I couldn’t understand how she perceived me. When we became a couple she said that those people meant nothing to her and there were only 3 or 4 girls she considered friends, and she actually wanted to communicate only with me. 

Later on Jane says she doesn’t talk to anyone except me. I didn’t ask for it and didn’t want to limit her socializing with others at all, so her decision was strange to me, but I accepted it. And that’s where our main problem started. It was hard to believe that Jane communicates only with me, so I decided to check the online activity of a guy that she used to chat with a lot. Me and Jane were spending a lot of time chatting and whenever she moved away from the chat, even for a moment, that guy appeared. It was like second to second coincidence and it was happening all the time. I asked Jane about this and she said she had nothing to do with it. My logic was that if these are really coincidences they have to stop at some point. But they didn’t. So several months after our time to time arguing about this I decided to just stop tracking that guy’s activity. 

The first situation that really affected me happened in the end of June. We had a bit of a fight and didn’t talk for a couple of days. 

One night Jane texts me saying that she wants to make up. She was drunk which she didn’t want to admit at first. We chatted a bit and she disappeared for two hours. Then she texts me again saying she smoked weed (it was her first time and it offended me a bit cause we were going to do it together). So I started to worry, asked her where she was and she evaded the question for like 2 or 3 times. Finally she says that she’s at some guys’ house with her friend(F) and some other people. 

For some reason it really stung me. It even felt like physical pain in chest and stomach imagining my girlfriend drunk and high laying at some guys’ house. So i cut off all contacts with her for about a week. That week was hell. Then I realized that my attitude to that situation might be wrong so we made up. Jane sweared that she hadn’t do anything bad that night. She said that she called a taxi home with her friend some time after our talk. 
Later we discussed this situation a lot and Jane said it would be better if she just didn’t tell anything that night. This concept scares me. 

A month later it turns out that it’s not exactly Jane’s photos on social networks. She photoshoped her face, but it wasn’t done to deceive me, she did that long before we met. She felt really bad about it and was afraid to confess the whole time. I didn’t blame her and assured that everything was fine, especially considering that difference with her real photos was minimal. 

The next strange thing I remember was one of her voicemails. Jane was working nightshifts at tech support. On her way home in the morning she recorded a voicemail. In the end of the record I heard her quitely but distinctly saying “Let’s go” as if she talked to someone. I wasn’t suspicious about it.
I don’t mind Jane communicating with other people. I was just curious and asked her whom she was talking to. She answered there wasn’t anybody with her that morning. That surprised me a bit, so I showed her that message. She says she can’t hear any “Let’s go” in it and that’s not what she said. Now that surprised me a lot. But at that moment she manages to hear the phrase. “Probably i said it to myself”. Ok, no big deal, such things happen. 

I visited her on a New Year and during one of our conversations I recalled that message. I couldn’t read that dialogue from my account anymore, so I asked Jane to play the voicemail. The whole conversation was more in a joking manner, not like me being suspicious or something, but her reaction was really weird. She refused to do that by any means. The dialogue went from humorous to more serious one. I asked her why is she so protective, she didn’t find what to say, she just answered she didn’t want to play that message. Later she said that it is embarrassing for her to do it because I heard something wrong in the voicemail so she doesn’t like that situation. She evaded my objections and changed the topic.

Two months of living together. We get drunk and she says that she has something to say but can’t yet. 

In December she was invited to a corporate party but didn’t go. A month ago we got drunk again, I decided to ask her more about that party because something was strange about it. Let me describe the situation:

Me: “Do you remember that we agreed not to drink at parties if we are not together there?”

Jane: “Yeah, and?”

M: “Did you drink at that corporate party in December?”

J: “No, we have an agreement about it and it means a lot to me”

M: “So what was at that party?”

J: “Food, drinks. Some guy got drunk and wrote to our own tech support with threats”
My mood noticeably changes at this point

M: “Well, but you said you weren’t there”
(I f*cked up here not asking her what was she doing at the party)

J: “My colleagues told me. I even told you about an angry client that wrote *me* at tech support and turned out to be one of our workers” 
(she was working from home that month)

M: “You didn’t” 

J: *tells about that situation*

She starts crying as I’m looking at her silently. 

J: “I didn’t go to that party. I said what was there because I don’t remember what I’ve said you earlier and don’t want to make things worse”

I say I don’t trust her. Jane starts crying even more saying it’s over and she takes tickets home. I don’t react. Then she says she’s ready to tell me something (I mentioned that above) and after this “there will be nothing left that I haven’t told you”. 

She changed her name to “Jane” three months ago. She said she didn’t like her previous name all her life and couldn’t live with it. She perceived herself as “Jane” and not her actual name. She said she was waiting for the right moment and was afraid to tell me all that time. 

I understand her. But I also remember how I said she could tell me anything and I promise that we won’t break up and discuss it. I said that several times and every time she answered there isn’t anything she hasn’t told me, though she knew I felt really bad about the feeling that something is wrong. 

Remember the story about the angry client that turned out to be one of the employees? The next day after our talk I realize that Jane didn’t work the night the party was being held. So the client wasn’t able to write her. She said it happened at another corporate party then and she didn’t go to that party too. She just doesn’t remember such things because she doesn’t attach any importance to it.

So now I still have this constant gut feeling. The things don’t add up. Idk how to explain it. It’s like I’m missing something or Jane lies about something. The thing is I don’t have any evidence to prove anything. 
What bothers me is that Jane herself confessed only about photos and her name. The two things that I would inevitably discover by myself sooner or later. 

We’ve talked about this feeling a lot, but it doesn’t help. 

What should I do? Why is there this feeling and how to get rid of it? Is something wrong with me or it’s more likely that my gf hides something? 
Any advice would be helpful, thank you

Edit: I formulated the question incorrectly. I understand why i get this feeling, but have zero evidence until she tells me something herself.  Everything she is saying now might be true until I discover the opposite. So the gut feeling just ruins our everyday life for now. And the fact that I don’t believe what she says makes me think that something might be wrong with me. 
So the question is more about how can I get rid of the feeling? Or is there any way I can find evidence to what she’s saying?
Thanks"
relationships,I'm [25M] texting a girl [21F] and my best friend [24F] is having an obsessive-jealousy-like tantrum over us texting,"I hope that the title is clear enough but the situation is following. I knew my friend for a long time, but only recently have we started actually talking so much (about 9 months now I think) that I actually treat her as my best girl friend. We are from the same city (capital of our country) and it is something very dear to us in our culture. Our city is basically ""our country"". However, I do live abroad for studies and we only see each other when I go home for vacation.

I've had my fit of liking due to constant chatting and I think she had one too, where shhe acted differently. But now I feel everything is back on track. As friends we are too close, perhaps even over the healthy limit which I should work on cutting down. There were no limits in our conversations, but we still supported each other in finding someone to nail - so to speak. She is basically the first person I ask for an opinion on something, or rant to when I'm having a shitty day. She also has a boyfriend now, and has had one before (another friend of mine, I connected them) so I don't know why she's throwing a jealous fit at me. 

Now, I mentioned we are from the same city and that city is the only place that is really relevant from all other places in our country to us. In our culture, we also dislike people from villages, probably because of a stereotype that they are usually uneducated, not well-mannered people, but I'm not that case.

I kind of like the girl I'm texting and we have been texting for a while now. Problem is - she is in another country (like, a third one) that is neighbouring our country. So, naturally, due to corona, I'm looking at ways I could get there when we decide to meet eventually.


Now, I talked to my friend about many girls that I've had dates and chats with, how they went etc. I never ""picked up"" any of those girls, and so probably she never had a reason to throw a jealous fit. BUT, she was always curious how it went every time.

Now, whenever I message her to talk to her about this girl, she hates the fact she is from a village and starts name calling her, raising her tone at me.

We now had a small chat-voice message fight, and I tried to calm her down. She kept telling me how she hates people like her, that I don't know her - so how can I like her, I never met her, I should be careful with girls like her, etc. Also, constantly mocking her birth place alluding she's worth less than someone from a big city per-se; but alongside all that, in a very angrily manner she told me a few times that she supports me and that if I'm happy she's happy.

Now, I'm not an idiot, I already suspected that she *might* be into me and that she's panicking due to the fact that I'm actually liking someone and it's working mutually apparently.

I sincerely hope this is not the case and that it might be something else. What do you think reddit, what should I do? I don't want to lose a friend, but I also don't want to stop chatting to this girl and potentially meeting her..

Tl;dr talking to a village girl, my girl best friend is throwing a jealous fit over us potentially mutually liking each other, without a good argument as to why it's not a good idea"
relationships,F24 unable to date/heal 2.5 years,"

So I had bad luck with guys and now I am unable to connect to anyone.I feel kind of empty (sounds pathetic I know) 

I am extroverted and easygoing my last relationship was 2.5 years ago and it was(1year) bad he emotionally abused me, read my messages on my phone while i was sleeping, tried to turn my friends against me, made me feel bad about how i look and always made me feel guilty about something I sad or did. In the end I was afraid to say anything,had constant migraines and felt like an absolute worthless piece of s**t. Finally I realized that I don’t have to suffer and left him. 


It took a long time but I went on a date it was 11 month ago, but the guy ghosted me after I slept with him. Since than I had no “taste” for man. I am unable to convince myself to date someone or try to get close to somebody.  Sometimes I really miss to have a man in my life and I wonder about dating but when a guy actually approaches me all these feelings turn into disgust. Don’t get me wrong i don’t hate man i have male friends and coworkers who I really like. I just feel like I had enough of bad experiences and I am unable to date. I also feel like something is wrong with me and cant even imagine that a normal guy would want to date me. I just feel so broken. 

What do you guys think of this? I am started to think about going to a therapist. Have you ever felt like this?

TL;DR: I am unable to trust or connect to guys and it makes me feel lonely. I had too many bad experiences and don’t know how to heal."
relationships,Should I see my Dad's Family on Father's Day?,"My (24F) mom (40) and dad(43) had me when they were both teenagers. He stuck around for about a year but wasn't in my life too much and then when I was four he disappeared completely for four years. He only came back into my life because his new wife found out my mom was trying to get her boyfriend at the time to adopt me. For the first couple years after he came back he was in my life consistently and I would see his side of the family pretty often too.

Once he and my first step mother divorced he started to fade out of my life again. I only saw him maybe once every 4 months and we never talked on the phone. This all changed when he met my current stepmother(36). He at first told her he only had two kids, my brothers from his first wife. Then he slowly let her know he has one more son from a previous relationship and then once they were together a full year he told her about me. 

I went to their wedding and it was fun being around him but I never really got close to her. She has a daughter from her first marriage that is 6 years younger than me and I managed to get close to her so that was the only good thing to come from my stepmother. 

From the age of 14 to 21 I saw my father 16 times. I moved in with him when I was 21 due to my mother and I not getting along ( horrible horrible mistake that I regret deeply). I thought our relationship would get better and it seemed like it did. He's never really been a father to me, just an older friend. 

I started dating my boyfriend at the time and they had no problem with him sleeping over or coming over whenever, they really like him and thought he was a good fit. When my ex cheated on me they both just shrugged it off and told me to give him another chance. 

My step sister (18) has always been a problem for my step mom. Bad attitude, lying, going out with her boyfriend who was 14 at the time. She moves in with my dad and stepmom and I and all of a sudden there is all these new rules. We both can't be out past a certain point, no bringing over random people, if we go somewhere then we must let them know where we're going. 

I never had a problem doing any of those things because my mom raised me to be respectful. I was an adult however so if I ever went out I would simply let them know who I was going to see and if I wasn't going to be home by 10 I just wouldn't come home. Flash forward a year to when I start dating my current boyfriend and they can't stand him. Never gave him a chance to show that hes a good guy because they just brushed him off. 

I would have him come over and we would hang out in my room and I had him stay over once because he was too drunk to drive home. He became homeless about 3 months into our relationship and I asked them if he could just stay here on the weekends sometimes so he could make sure he gets a nice shower and a bed. They said no because it's not in the rules. So I had him come over everyday after he was done with work so I could feed him and let him relax before he had to go sleep in his car. 

I'll admit that I snuck him over twice without their knowledge but I wanted him to sleep in a bed. Around the beginning of November I went out to dinner with my boyfriend and by the time he came to drop me off the temperature dropped to 35 degrees. I snuck him in because that's way too cold for him to be sleeping in his car and I was going to explain to them in the morning why I let him sleep over since they were both asleep when we got back. 

I got a text from my dad in the morning telling me I was the most disrespectful person he's ever met, he's going to hurt my boyfriend if he sees him and that I need to move out immediately. We went to my moms and stayed there for a week before my dad texted me to let me know all my stuff if outside and I need to come get it. Once we got all my stuff and moved back to my moms it was fine. I haven't heard from my dad since that day but I know he's been telling people I'm a bad person/daughter because I won't apologize and I won't talk to him. My stepmother would text me occasionally and tell me she hopes I'm doing okay and I would always just respond with ""you too"". 

She texted me the other day saying how she wished things were different and I finally got the courage to say ""I wish things were different too. I wish my father actually wanted to be my father."" She told me that he tried but I was too difficult because he was too scared to be a dad and decided he was just going to be my friend. 

I've now been invited to a cookout at my dad's sisters house on fathers day and all my aunts and cousins have been telling me I need to go but I don't know if I'm ready to see my dad yet. I know maybe I did some things wrong but I wasn't going to let my homeless boyfriend freeze just because they didn't like him. 

Also I'm sorry this is probably so hard to read because I'm terrible at writing. I just tried to get all of this out of my head.

Tl;DR Dad kicked me out because boyfriend stayed over and now we don't speak. I'm supposed to see him on father's day."
relationships,My (22f) girlfriend almost never wants to have sex or be touched by me (22m),"I've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and we both love each other very much and are both more of less very happy together (no relationship is perfect) but in the entire time we've been together we've probably had sex less than 15 times. When we first started dating it was probably a good 3-4 months (can’t remember exactly) before we had first had sex, which is understandable. She then explained to me that her ex was quite forceful and borderline abusive when it came to sex which is why she wanted to wait for so long which I was perfectly okay with. I told her that I would never try to force myself upon in her in any way and that we'd only have sex if she was comfortable with it. After we first had sex we would then have sex very few and far between. We would go out together quite often (drinking, clubbing etc.) but whenever we would get back to my place she would always say how tired she was and she'd get straight into her PJs and go to sleep. After a while I asked why she never wanted to have sex when we got back from nights out and she told me that she was always too drunk (normally we both are) and just the same stuff she said about her ex before, I Didn’t press too hard cos I Didn’t want to upset her or make her uncomfortable. Anyways, as time went on nothing changed and we were still having sex very infrequently and even when we've taken trips away together she just shows no signs of wanting to have sex with me. At the start I would always try to initiate it and more often than not she'd reject me so I began to wait to see if she'd ever try to initiate it which she never did. I know she has some self esteem issues so I always compliment her and try to make her feel beautiful and sexy, I always try to be gentle with her but it never seems to get me anywhere. More recently she's become even less physical with me and hardly ever wants to kiss me or be touched by me and she tries to play it off in a jokey way but I find it strange. If I try to touch her in a sexual way she always just says she can't because her vagina hurts. I completely understand that she had problems in her past relationship that aren't easy to get over but it just makes me wonder how long it will be before she is comfortable enough. I get annoyed at myself because sometimes the situation makes me resent her a little bit which makes me feel shitty. I've even wondered if she just doesn't find me sexually attractive. She rarely compliments my appearance and if she does it's always just ""you look nice"" or she calls me a beautiful boy which is quite nice lmao but nothing she says ever insinuates that she wants to rip my clothes off. I love her very much and can see myself being with her forever but how long can someone realistically be in a basically sexless relationship.

TL;DR GF of nearly 2 years never wants to have sex or be touched"
relationships,How common is it to not have each other's presence on social media?,"My (30F) boyfriend (31M) doesn't have me on social media at all. I posted something earlier. But it got me thinking, I am also nowhere to be seen on his social media and he appears single. We have been together for 1.5 years. All his friends on the other hand do have their SO's on there. I do not need him to write me posts about his love for me on there or anything like that. But a complete absence seems odd to me. 

How common is this? And it is immature of me to like to have a photo of us together on there?

&#x200B;

TLDR: How common is it to have no signs/photo of your SO on your social media?"
relationships,Do you think he's lying or cheating?,"We've been together for 7 months, I go over his place once in a week or twice now it depends, he's not sexually active like before (he hasn't been always like this, he used to initiate since we met although i used to meet him almost everyday) he doesn't even get an erection when we make out.


We stopped having sex for almost 2 months, when i asked him if there's anything wrong he kept telling me that he doesn't masturbate or anything and he hates how he feels after masturbating.

I doubted it because for the last 2 months, i used to find lots of tissues squeezed together next to his bed  (i think it's because he wipes his semen after masturbating and sleeps before throwing them in the trashcan)


Last time i asked him again if he masturbates and he insisted he's not!


I think he masturbates a lot i keep finding these tissues every time i go to his place


I don't know if this counts or not, but we had sex 3 days ago and it was completely dark in the room we couldn't see each others' faces so i think it might be another significant



I don't know why he's lying about this and what's the big turn off? I need your help guy.


Tl;dr
My boyfriend hadn't had sex with me for almost 2 months, he tells me he hates masturbating, he masturbates and lies to me."
relationships,"I heard my parents (mid 40s m&f) bashing my relationship (f20,m20) to other relatives.","For background information, my boyfriend and I have been in a committed relationship for 4 years. We have recently moved in together. We are not engaged and we will not be rushing into marriage. My family is primarily LDS and our relationship is not seen as a valid relationship according to their religion, from what I understand. 

Over the past few weeks my parents have begged my boyfriend and I to watch their dogs so they could go to a cabin with other extended family members. It was for Memorial Day weekend which also falls on my birthday. We both said no because we were planning on doing something for my birthday and didn’t want to be tied down to dog sitting. 

That was until my mother called me hysterically crying because she missed her family and really wanted to go but the dogs weren’t allowed. I eventually gave in to calm her down. She offered us to stay in their house (we live a few towns over) specifically their bedroom because it is the only one that has a bed for two. 

The night they left we drive over with our things prepared to spend the night. We arrive at the house and it is filthy. I’m immediately inclined to clean it up because that’s just what I do, I clean things no matter what. While I’m cleaning, my boyfriend is tending to the dogs. Once I finish cleaning I go out to the car to grab a few things to bring into the room where we’re staying. 

It’s locked. All the bedrooms are locked. I’m confused because it had been offered for us to stay so we didn’t have to make multiple trips constantly to check on their dogs. (We cannot bring the dogs to our small apartment) I call them thinking it must be a mistake. I was rudely informed it wasn’t. 

They both were yelling at me over the phone how we don’t need to stay in their house and use their things. I was shocked. I don’t want to be here in the first place, I’m watching your dogs FOR FREE, and you don’t want me to stay there instead you want me to drive for hours everyday to check on your dogs. I was obviously really hurt and not to mention frustrated. I wish I had known that before I cleaned their house. I informed them I couldn’t do the driving and they would have to find someone else.

I wish I was kidding when I tell you their response. “No, we won’t find anyone else. Thanks for watching the dogs.” They hang up. My brother then calls me and tells me to mute myself. I proceed to hear them rant to all of our extended family about how much me and my boyfriend disgusted them. 

They mentioned how we are living in sin, saying he won’t propose to me because I’ve already had sex with him, judging our tattoos/piercings, making fun of my boyfriends job (he’s a manager at an auto shop), and they topped it off by saying that’s why weren’t invited for family pictures (which I learned is what they were doing up there). 

I eventually hung up because I was just shocked. I never knew that is how they truly feel. I continued to take care of the dogs that weekend and we stayed at a friends house instead of theirs to save gas and time. I sent my mom a text and told her that I heard what they had to say and I will not be doing anything for them anymore. 

This isn’t the first times they have been that nasty toward me. I am honestly through. This was the last straw. I have been trying to distance myself from them and their beliefs hence why we moved away. They have been blowing my phone trying to apologize but I don’t forgive them. I don’t want to subjected to their scrutiny anymore. 

The point of this whole thing, how do you cut off a relationship with your parents as an adult? I no longer want them in my life but I feel I may never escape them. It’s gotten to the point where I would like to be removed legally from them if that’s even possible. 

TL;DR I was trying to do a favor for my parents but I overheard them going on a smear campaign about me and my relationship. They have done this throughout my life and now I’m done. I am now wanting to sever ties with them but not sure how to."
relationships,My Bf (28M) and me (25f) are at a cross roads. Break up or move to a new city I don’t want to be in.,"I have been dating my Bf(28M) for almost 5 years now. Lets call him Matt. We met in college and have been living together for two years. We have a dog together and he truly is my best friend. 

He is like my other half and we are (for the most part; every relationship has its ups and downs) very happy together. 

I mention all of this because we are basically married. We act like an old married couple, we plan our future as if we are married, and we plan financially as if we are married. 

But we aren’t. I want to get married, he says he’s not ready. This is important because technically we have nothing binding us together. No child, no mortgage, no debts. 

My problem is this: Recently, Matt applied to a position at a military base as a higher up engineer. He has been offered a position that pays very well and has really good benefits. 

At first I was very excited for him as this is a huge opportunity for him right out of grad school. It’s a two year contract and this could be a huge stepping stone for his career and financial success. However, I am now stressed out of my mind about moving. 

This military base is in a very small town in a state I have never wanted to live in. In the past he actually asked me where I would want to live and my exact words where “ idc, as long as its not in bum fucking ( state that the job is in)”

I have been internally struggling this this move for a few months now. He is fully aware of my feelings but keeps telling “we are a team” and “this will be a great start for our lives together”

However, we are not married. This job is a great opportunity for HIM not for US. We split everything; groceries, rent, etc. Jobs in my field are very limited in this city and it’s a full 2 hours away from any major city. 

He said he’d be willing to not take the job but I know deep down he doesn’t want to give this job up. And truthfully he is young and just started out and I don’t think he should have to. 

Though it may be irrational, I fear if I move with him I may lose valuable youthful years and years I could use building a strong career for myself. That I may resent him for putting my career and future on hold. 

Especially at my age, kids are something that I always thought I would have in my late 20s. 

He wants me to move with him still and I just feel like if I move with him I am not being true to myself. This little town holds no value to me other than him. Should I move to a state I never wanted to live in for a great job opportunity for my Bf? Even if it costs me unhappiness? 

To me, this just feels like a make or break decision. Like one of those pivotal moments in life that changes our trajectory. Do I chose the person I loves happiness or do I chose my own?

Should I take this as a sign we should spilt and live our own lives? 

TLDR: Long time BF has great job offer in state I don’t want to move to. I feel if I move with him I may sacrifice my own career prospects and success. Choosing between my unhappiness or his."
relationships,Mum said i'm wrong for telling Child Support that I 'suspect' my ex partner may be working.,"Recently I applied for Child Support and the agreement is he gives me **16 a fortnight** (he is/'was' on goverment payments/centrelink ($1,000 fortnight).  I'm not sure if he is still on it now though. 

My ex never see's, and _hardly_ calls to talk to the kids and the last payment I got off him was _before_ i applied for CS and he transferred $150 to my bank on the 21st of april. Since then I have got nothing, not even my CS. 

I recently seen on his Facebook page and instagram that he is friends/following a concreting business(my ex would always get concreting jobs throughout our relationship. So thats why i'm assuming he has a job. Also, because he seems to be buying alot of new things/getting new clothes/hair cuts. He is even talking about getting a new motorbike. He is also friends with the boss and the boss's wive on instagram/fb, another reason why I suspect he has a job with them. 

So today I rang CS and told them that **I suspect** my ex is working and they said they'll call him and I also gave them the company name to where I think he may be working, he'll just deny he is working anyways so nothing will probably come out of this, anyways(I don't think?) 

I told my mum what I did and she is fuming and even called me a snitch and that I shouldn't have called child support over such a low amount of money. She said ""**you never call the goverment and dob in people, thats wrong, i'd never do that. Especially not over $16 and you don't even know for sure if he is working, just leave him be and move on** 

Was I wrong? Also what will CS do now that I've told them I suspect he is working, what if my ex denies he is and it turns out he _is_ will CS investigate? My mum has made me regret what I did

**TL:DR - was it wrong that I rang CS telling them i suspect my ex is working without any actual proof?**"
relationships,Did I make the right choice?,"Hello everyone, 

I’ve (F, 21) been dating my boyfriend (23) for about two years now. We work at the same job, doing completely different things, but my coworkers occasionally bring up how he’s flirting with our other female coworkers. Usually when I hear stuff like this, I blow it off because I trust my boyfriend. But today, someone brought a situation to me and showed me video proof. I watched a girl I had previously told him I didn’t like for this exact reason feeding him candy, getting really close to him, and positioning her hands towards his crotch on camera. He leaned into her face so closely it looked like they kissed. I was extremely hurt and embarrassed. So I brought it up when I came home from work, which led to him to start laughing and telling me I’m crazy and I’m insecure. He said he can’t believe I still don’t trust him after two years and that they weren’t doing anything in the video. I feel like another girl shouldn’t be feeding you anything and why would her hands be near your private areas? Doesn’t make sense. I felt completely unheard and like my feelings were invalidated so I broke up with him right there on the spot. He immediately called his parents, told them I broke up with him and started packing his stuff in our house. He took our bed, our toilet paper, everything. He threw all my stuff on the ground, broke our picture, just went crazy on me. And here I am thinking maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. I can’t stop crying. He basically told me that he’ll have his half of the rent next week and that’s really the only reason I need to contact him. I just feel like if he really loved me, he wouldn’t have reacted that way. I’m just so hurt. Did I make the right choice? 

TL;DR: caught boyfriend on camera really close with another girl which resulted in him saying I’m crazy and insecure instead of apologizing and telling me what I saw wasn’t what I think it was. So I broke up with him. He’s started moving all of his stuff out and I feel miserable."
relationships,"My girlfriend (18F) of 1.5 yrs lied about seeing her ex, am I (18M) overreacting?","Hey Reddit. Just want to start by saying I really appreciate any advice you can offer me as I’m young and probably naive when it comes to dating.

Anyway, a few weeks ago my gf was at the lake and her ex (who lives nearby) happened upon her and they talked for an hour or so. I do not think this was premeditated (she goes to the lake frequently, this time her ex happened to see her there), and her ex was the initiator. Still, we’ve had previous arguments about this ex in the past, where she ultimately promised to not hang out with him, and limit talking as much as possible.

Back to the lake. She didn’t tell me anything about this incident, which I would’ve liked her to do, so I knew nothing of it for weeks. Then, a few days ago she mentioned a friend growing a beard in a group chat, I asked her who, she made up a story about someone she talked to in a one-time Zoom call and quickly changed the subject. Well that didn’t sit well with me, and long story short, after a bit of back-and-forth she confessed that she was referring to her ex, and told me about the lake incident. She said she didn’t want to tell the truth because she was afraid I would get mad, and “nothing happened anyway.”

I got pissed off immediately and am now seriously considering breaking up. I feel that she a) didn’t have to have such a long conversation with her ex in the first place, b) should’ve told me immediately after, and most importantly, c) definitely shouldn’t have lied about it. Another indirect factor is the fact that she has refused to see me during quarantine because she doesn’t want me to infect her parents, yet she was still okay with talking to her ex. Regardless, I think she has severely damaged the trust in our relationship.

Am I overreacting by considering breaking up? How would you react? Thank you!

TL;DR - Gf talked to ex (not pre-meditated, but still breaking a promise), did not tell me, and then later lied about it."
relationships,I’ve only been with one girl my entire life. She wants to get married. Feel like I’m missing out on life but I’m scared to lose her. Is it time to call it off? (19M).,"
So I’ve been with my gf at the time for 2 years. I went to an all boys school so I pretty much had no interaction with girls in my high school years. I met my gf through social media (we had mutual friends). I thought she was very pretty and tried extremely hard to get her and finally did. At the start of the relationship everything was good, I was still trying to impress her and was extremely attracted to her, started imagining us getting married etc. 

Fast forward 2 years and the relationship is kind of getting boring to me. I still love this girl to bits and am still attracted to her, she is definitely wifey material, but I feel like I haven’t experienced anything. She wants to continue dating until we get married and I don’t want to sound arrogant but I feel like she really does deeply love me. 

The problem is I haven’t even talked to another girl yet in my life so Idk what it even feels like. I feel like I’m missing out on a big portion of life. All my mates are chatting to many girls and stuff and I must admit I find girls at university really attractive. I really have urges to chat up girls but obviously I don’t because I would never do that to my gf. 

My problem is that if I continue being with my gf until we get married, then ive pretty much been with only ONE girl my entire life. I just can’t get that out my head and I feel like I’ve missed out on so much. Forget having only one gf in my life, I haven’t even talked (flirtatiously) to another girl besides my gf ever. 

I would call it off but I really don’t want to let this girl go. I feel like she’s so perfect for me and I really want to wife her. But I just want to experience what being single feels like. If I break up with her and we both go our separate ways then I’ve lost a girl who was super wholesome and in love with me and I’m scared I’ll regret it. If I don’t break up with her and we end up getting married, then I’ve pretty much gone my whole entire life only talked to and been with ONE girl. I just feel like I’ve missed out in so much, but I really don’t want to lose this girl forever.

Such a fucked dilemma to be in. What do you guys think? Do you think if we break up for now, there’s still a possibility that we can get married in the future??

TL;DR - only been with and spoken to one girl (my gf) my whole life. Feel like I’m missing out but scared to lose her forever. Should I end it?"
relationships,How do I [31F] tell my friend [30F] that I'm not okay with her visiting anymore?,"Sorry in advance for potential wall of text, I'm really struggling with this.

I've been friends with Beth since college, and she's a truly great friend. I won't make you read a whole ramble about it, but suffice it to say that this friendship means a ton to me, and I don't want to nuke it if I can help it. Normally, we try to see each other once a year or so (we haven't lived in the same place since we were about 25), but it's been over 2 years since we've seen each other due to life circumstances. In November, I moved to a new city and the plan was for her to come visit for a week in June.

Since we made this plan, there have been some complications:

* I was supposed to be on an intensive project with a new client this month, but due to the crisis' impact on the client's business, it got pushed to June, overlapping with part of Beth's visit. This would be my first solo project and will mean the difference between my getting promoted this year and not. I was told about this in March, and immediately let Beth know that I wouldn't be able to take vacation during the four weekdays she'll be here like I originally planned. She said that was fine, and she'd entertain herself during those days. Fair enough.
* My city was one of the hardest hit in our part of the US, and hasn't even started to look at easing restrictions. There is absolutely no way I'm going to be able to take Beth to see any of the cool things the city has to offer, or frankly even really do much of anything outside of our apartment. Again, I relayed this to her several times in the past month, saying that I think we should hold off on a visit until things are back to normal and she can have the full experience. She brushed it off, saying we could cook and go for walks.
* My husband is now working from home 90% of the time as well. Our apartment is less than 800 square feet, only 3 rooms. I work in the guest room and he works in the living room/kitchen combo, because we have so many meetings that we can't be in the same room without disturbing each other and the bedroom doesn't have room for anything except a bed. Bluntly put, things have already been stressful and tense with the two of us together in the apartment 24/7 and no breathing room, I'm not really looking forward to adding a third person to that mix for a whole week. Not only that, there's noplace you can be in the apartment without being in earshot of everyone else, so Beth and I wouldn't even have a chance to have a one-on-one conversation without an audience unless we were walking around outside.
* I already have a chronic illness. It's nothing that (to my knowledge) puts me at higher risk of dying were I to get infected, but I already have a lifelong set of health struggles and complications to think about, so I don't relish the idea of potentially adding more (lung damage, etc) to the list.
* Frankly, my stress levels and depression are through the roof right now, as I think most peoples' are. I can barely bring myself to function like a human being at work most days right now, let alone play hostess (no matter how much Beth insists that I don't need to do so).

I'm at my wits' end because every time I try to gently bring any of these things up with Beth, she brushes me off. Twice, she's literally said something to the effect of ""nope, I can't talk about this, I have to pretend that the world will be back to normal by then"". Okay, I get that, but it's now three weeks away and I still can't get her to engage on this. She's clearly not taking the whole situation as seriously as I am, probably partially because her city has had far fewer cases. She's started posting things on FB about how this isn't a big deal (not the ""it's a hoax"" stuff, more ""we all need to accept some degree of risk and get on with our lives"" stuff). I love her, and I don't want to make things worse for her (because I know she's also struggling a ton), but a) I'm just not okay with the risk of someone staying in close quarters with me after going through two international airports right now, and b) the idea of having a third person stuck in this apartment 24/7 while my husband and I try to work sounds stressful enough that I've had more than one panic attack thinking about it. How do I make this clear to Beth and get her to engage on this without destroying our relationship?

**TL;DR Friend is determined to go through with our planned visit despite the pandemic. I now have a work conflict and our city won't even be open by then. How do I firmly tell her we need to reschedule without ruining our friendship?**"
relationships,"6 y relationship ended yesterday out of lying, cheating and behaviour issues","I (26 M) ended my relationship with my ex (24 F) yesterday after reuniting with her again for a year. We first ended back in December 2017 after 4.5y together because we both had behavioural issues. I was verbally abusive, aggressive, and wanted things my way. She had strong lack of attention, laziness, immaturity and deep communication problems. We stayed apart for 2 years before reuniting again in April 2019.

In this period we stayed apart we both were extremely hurt and realised there was no way we could continue together because we both had to deal with our own problems, and mature to become better individually better. I focused heavily into therapy for 1.5 years, older trusted and mature people advice, religion, solid friendships and a support group. She decided to go to a foreign country for a exchange trip and English training for 6 months and there she said she was changed for good, but never committed herself with any therapy, or any behavioural or communication advice from anybody.

After she came back from the exchange program we still had the same friends group and eventually got closer. It was obvious to everybody we still loved each other and had strong feelings for one another. One day we had a one in a lifetime encounter, we had a sincere talk, cried, asked for forgiveness from our mistakes, expressed things we never shared, and it was a very sincere life changing event for our relationship. Since this date we got even closer and although we had some sparks here and there, we talked to our families and I asked her parents for forgiveness for my behaviour in the past, our friends continued to support us coming back together and that's what we did. In April 2019 we were back as a couple.

After we got back together I was slowly realising she didn't really changed. It was truly a mistake to get back together, she portrayed to be a completely different person coming back from her 6 months trip. She was visually changed and she could really convince that she had really changed while in her alone time immerse in a completely different culture, but she really wasn't. She just got back with the same behavioural issues, the same or even worse communication problems and she even got jealousy issues with a female friend who had and still has a boyfriend till this day.

As time went by our problems from the first time we were together started to face and new problems were put in the table. She decided to go to a voluntary trip to the amazon forest to help locals in need and there she met another volunteer guy, felt in love with him and even mentioned to her tutor that she wanted to stay and live with him and do volunteer work for life. While in the trip she constantly ignored my messages, saying it was lack of service in the woods, but she could post pictures no prob everyday. I just felt she was acting weird but we never had betrayal history or anything like that..

When she came back from her trip she felt guilty and told everything that happened to me. I instantly felt sick and cried and decided to go home. She was like another person to me. She was even still feeling ""jet lag"" but in a different way. She was still attached to the other guy and couldn't decide what she wanted. Me or her life in the woods with this guy she just met for a week. And then I went of to my car and there she entered my car as I was still in shock with everything that happened and couldn't start the engine. We stayed sit there just crying. And after several minutes I just hugged her and said I forgive her. And she promised she would work things out and completely forget about the guy.

After that moment trusting her was very hard. She still had him in her social network, he would still talk to her occasionally up until 3 weeks or something that she completely blocked him and she never mentioned him again. But trust was never the same. She still had strong lack of attention, lack of empathy, laziness, insecurity issues, jealousy when there was clearly nothing and general immaturity, not being able to sustain a grown up relationship.

She would still refuse to put herself into therapy or communication tutoring, she basically never did anything to improve her behaviour issues and become a better person. She would hide things from me saying she thought I would react in a specific way. She would constantly put herself into trouble at work because she couldn't communicate well and her clients would complain about her. She would only say she was sorry after every single fight we had and promise to change whenever she felt we were about to break up and put herself into her knees and beg for forgiveness but in real life after I had forgiven her each and every time selflessly she would do nothing to improve and act different.

It was up until this week that things really ended for us. I was in the hospital with my mom letting her into a room to be taken into ICU because she was not getting better from home treatment for covid 19 for the past 2 weeks. I asked if she could stay with me on the phone because it was going to be a very difficult situation to face alone. I asked if she could call me twice a day or just send me supportive messages, but she said that she wouldn't have any time available to help and be present for me because she had her post graduate orthodontics training to take that week and she was supposed to be busy from 7am till 5pm, but I left the hospital at 8pm and she didn't say a word about how we were doing and if my mom was really taken into ICU.

That only showed me how little she cared for me. But then when I thought things couldn't get worse I found out she lied to me saying she had to take this course, but instead she was selling a online English course all day and wanted to beat the company selling records as she was performing really good. The only way I found out about this is because her selling report was shared onine by somebody in her family to congratulate her on being the person that most sold English courses that day.

That was it for me. She left me alone taking my mom into ICU and couldn't even text me to give me courage and support while she was selling English courses online. She lied about not being available to be there for me and this was her last lie. We had a huge argument on how she never changed, on how us coming back together was the worst mistake I've ever done. On how she refused this whole 6 years together to search for professional help for her behaviour issues while I took no extra time to spend 1.5 years on therapy and get my shit together. She cheated on me less than 3 months we got back together, she would constantly lie about things, hide things from me, and act out of immaturity.

We broke up yesterday after several, infinite times I openly forgave her of her mistakes, after 6 years waiting for her to improve on herself and completely letting go the cheating, the trust issues I had after the lies, and just negotiating what was never to be negotiable in a adult relationship, just because I loved her to death. And I thought she would be my wife in the future and the mother of my child. I am here today, still deeply in love with her, still suffering like crazy, still having to face my mom being put into ICU and I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:
broke up 6y relationship yesterday because of cheating, lying, behavioural issues, immaturity, and communication problems but still deeply in love with her. I dealt with my behavioural issues for a 1.5 years in therapy and became a more mature man but she refuses to treat her problems after 6 years. To make things worse my mom is in ICU treating covid 19 and I feel completely lost and I don't know what to do."
relationships,"Me [34 M] with my Wife [31 F] of 12 years, How do I engage her pessimism?","The wording of my title may be a bit confusing - sorry, I couldn't think of a better short hand for it. Basically what it comes down to is that, while I understand she doesn't always need my help 'fixing' things that she wants to talk about I don't know how to engage with her on certain subjects without being 'optimistic?'

As an example - she is studying to become a CNA and the place she's studying at has a 95% pass rate. She's incredibly comfortable with about 80% of the material and relatively good on the rest. She tests tomorrow and I've been helping her study. She is convinced she's going to fail. All day yesterday when I was helping her study she was talking about how doomed she was and how it all seems hopeless. Don't get me wrong - I understand that the potential to fail exists - she could freeze up during the test, have a stickler teacher, or get a bad assortment of test scenarios and screw up. It could happen. But it seems like those are the outliers. But she only sees those potentialities.

Obviously in scenarios like this I shouldn't respond with ""Sorry"" or ""That sucks"" - agreeing with her pessimism isn't helpful. But me trying to explain how good her odds are or pointing out that if she fails she can study and try again (up to twice again with different teachers administering the test and different test scenarios that she may be comfortable with), plus if she failed entirely it would suck but wouldn't be the end of the world.

Me being confident about her odds upset her. She says she's not like me and capable of just being confident about things working out but I argued that it's not about blind confidence - it's about the odds. In most outcomes she's good, in most of the outcomes where she fails tomorrow she's good within a week. In none of the outcomes where she fails completely is our life impacted in a major way - it sucks but it's just not worth stressing about. It led to a fight that we resolved relatively quickly but the question remains - what am I supposed to do? If she's being super pessimistic neither of us think that just... ignoring it or agreeing with it is helpful, but trying to help does nothing but frustrate her as well.

---
**tl;dr**: Sometimes my wife gets pessimistic. Neither of us wants me to 'support' that mindset but she also doesn't want me to try and 'help' either which leaves me feeling like there's no way to engage."
relationships,I (23M) moved out of home after my mum (62F) verbally abused my girlfriend (21F),"This has been stewing in the back of my mind for the past month or so and now with a quiet night to myself I'd like to put it out there for any advice or personal experiences that anyone may be able to share.

I (23M) have lived at home with my parents for all of of my life. In 2016 my dad passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly, and up until early April of this year my mum (62F) and I continued to live together in our family home. We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but we've always been relatively close. When my dad passed away we both had different ways of dealing with it; where she had the family gather around her and focused on her own passions I preferred the company of friends and to spend a fair share of my time alone. Although we were both getting used to the new family dynamic of a household of two and changes to our everyday home lives we somehow slowly drifted apart from each other, no longer being as close as we once were.

In July last year I met my girlfriend (F21) and after quickly becoming very close my mum and I discussed her coming to live with us as her own at-home family dynamic always sort of left her as the odd one out. In February of this year she moved in and all seemed to be going well with her getting on well with my mum, her feeling more comfortable in a different household dynamic, and overall helping to make the home feel a little more lively again. Within a month however issues started to arise with my mum and girlfriend both being from very different family backgrounds and having quite different personalities. My mum has always been very particular about our family home as she made it into what it is with my dad, and where she is always very tidy and clean my girlfriend is a little more relaxed and somewhat forgetful; often leaving drawers or the fridge open by accident and taking a few days to pick up her dirty clothes from the bedroom floor. Where my girlfriend is very casual about humour and her family often likes to make harmless fun of each other my mum is not good at taking a joke and is offended very easily. The only things that I feel that my mum and girlfriend have in common beyond their interests are that they are both quite sensitive and rather stubborn.

By early April and well into our country's lock-down for Covid-19 we were all having issues within the household dynamic:

My mum was always having mood swings and would go from being totally fine one minute to being in the most foul mood the next. She would always be pulling me aside to voice her grievances against my girlfriend ranging from complaining that she was lazy, careless and rude to accusing her of trying to push my mum out of my life, wanting to take over and redecorate her home, and talking about her behind her back. I would try to explain things to my mum like how my girlfriend has always been forgetful ever since being on medication for depression and that her jokes aren't snarky stabs at her, rather that she is from a family where that is the norm. I never brushed away my mum's concerns, but I would remind her that my girlfriend's actions and behaviors aren't intentional but rather the result of how she was brought up and what she is used to at home.

My girlfriend on the other hand was growing increasingly anxious living with my mum and I; she was always on-edge waiting for my mum to have another angry outburst and often felt like she had to tip-toe around everywhere to not upset my mum. She would often have anxiety attacks at night where she would cry for hours on end and would often talk to me about her concerns with my mum's behavior - towards me in particular, and how she would like us to look into moving into a place of our own. Something to note is that my girlfriend doesn't have any friends of her own, outside of work my mum and myself were her only source of interaction - with the further exclusion of her work once the lock-down started.

As for myself I was just having a hard time trying to keep both my mum and my girlfriend happy, I would often feel caught in the middle trying to hold things together and would increasingly often just try to find relief by playing video games with my friends online. I hated the way that my mum and girlfriend couldn't get along and worst of all this caused me to start doubting my feelings and future with my girlfriend as as they say ""your mum knows best"". 

After a while though I started to feel more and more that my mum's behavior was the cause of the tension within the house. Her mood swings would become ridiculous with me seriously wondering if she was bipolar. She would walk around the house slamming cupboards and snapping back at me with the most awful tone, and when my mood would begin to reflect hers she would act totally normal and ask why I was in a bad mood and say that I had no reason to be annoyed with her. If my girlfriend and I gave each other a hug and my mum saw it she would accuse me of being inconsiderate, and if caught hugging or doing anything remotely affectionate in our own room with each other she would stomp in and pull the door closed with a slam. However at the same time if we were in our bedroom with the door closed to have some time to ourselves she would later complain that we 'shut ourselves away' and question why we were even living there if we didn't want to interact with her. 

Even I can see that this behavior likely stems from the emotional pain of seeing my girlfriend and I in a budding relationship while she is still mourning the loss of her own, but her moods went even beyond this. If I came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone my mum would call me out for taking out my frustrations on others, I would recognize this, quickly apologize and take some time to unwind. If my mum came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone if I made a comment about it I would be met with total hostility, told that how dare I judge her in her own home, and that if I didn't like it we could move out. My mum would hold grudges and be in moods for days, and when she did finally come around she would never apologize for her actions or attitude. Perhaps one of the biggest things too is that she is never able to be wrong, and I mean never. Even while growing up during arguments with her my dad would tell me to just accept that it was my fault and apologize, not because I was wrong (although obviously sometimes I was), but because ""she can't be wrong and she won't accept that she is"". 

There is so much more that I wish I could add but this post has grown so long already. One thing I will add though was how often she would bring up how my girlfriend and I could move out, every single time she was in a mood or started an argument she would say ""you two don't choose to live here, I *allow* you to live here"", or ""you two don't have to live here, you can quite easily move out"". Often as arguments would calm down she would change to ""believe it or not I actually like you two living here, but if you two want to move out that's up to you"". My mum has always known that the idea of moving out has terrified me, and I feel like that's why she brought it up so often.

So this brings us to about a month and a half ago, mid-lock-down, one night my mum comes into our room while my girlfriend is in the bathroom and gives me the ultimatum that I need to ask her to move out within the next three days otherwise she'll ask her herself and ""in front of me"". I told my girlfriend about it immediately and we decided that as soon as the lock-down was over that we'd both go flatting together instead - which is something that we had already been considering for weeks. The next day I had volunteered to help a local businessman cut firewood for his landscaping company (while adhering to lock-down work protocols, of course) and when I got home I could already see that things were tense with my mum in a matter-of-fact mood and my girlfriend doing her best to be calm and collected. Comments were made about me earning money and how I still needed to pay some money back to my mum for some expenses that she had helped me with while I wasn't working (we're talking about a couple of thousand) and I made the comment about how I wouldn't be able to pay her back as much as I had been (one third of my paycheck each week) once we go flatting as we'd have other expenses too like rent and groceries.

*and     shit     hit     the     fan*

What ensued was an absolutely horrible evening. My mum let rip but almost entirely at my girlfriend making comments such as ""you are the nastiest bitch I have ever met"" and that ""I hope my son meets a really nice girl one day who isn't you because I don't want you as a daughter in-law"". My girlfriend decided that she had had enough and was moving back to her parents's house immediately, as did I, and we instantly began packing up everything we owned. For the next couple of hours we loaded our cars, all the while my mum harassed us asking for our house keys and telling us to hurry up and get out of her house. At some points she wouldn't allow my girlfriend back into the house and instead threw her belongings out onto the brick path, she yelled in my girlfriend's face and at one point my girlfriend yelled back, and when my girlfriend finally broke down in tears my mum said to her face with a mocking tone ""aw is wittle \[girlfriend's name\] gonna cry now?"". Throughout this whole thing I amazingly managed to stay relatively calm, but I'm not going to lie that it took a lot for me to not go through that house like a fucking tornado. After a few hours we managed to get 80% of our things out and with the help of my girlfriend's dad we got it all back to their house. Her parents were nice enough to take us in and we've been staying with them ever since while we wait for the flat that we are going to move in to become available. 

In the time since then I haven't spoken to my mum all that much, I've been back to the house a couple of times to collect more things and the atmosphere has been a bit like that between strangers. She contacts me like nothing has happened whenever she needs something and one time when I called her to ask for advice about car insurance she was rather nasty about it and made the comment ""well it's real nice that that's all that you called to talk about and didn't even wish me a happy mother's day"" and hung up, even though it was over a week before mother's day. She's also made contact with me a number of times to talk about a repayment scheme that she's writing up with her lawyer to have me pay back everything she's ever paid for me over the past four years and with interest even though a legally binding agreement was never formed, and we are now looking at tens of thousands rather than just thousands.

And that's pretty much where it stands. I'm angry and I'm upset because I don't understand how things with my mum have gotten this way, with my dad the three of us were the most incredibly close family and now he's gone and things are like this. I'm angry at her for how she's behaved, and I'm absolutely appalled at the things that she said to my girlfriend - no one should speak to anyone like that, and definitely not a 62 year-old who's welcomed their son's 21 year-old girlfriend into their home. I don't want anything to do with her for a good while to come, and even though that's my decision it upsets me. It's her birthday on Thursday and although I don't want to do anything a part of me says that I should.

I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this absolute novel, I've been bottling this for well over a month and sometimes you just need to blast the shit for the world to read. Does anyone have any advice or personal lessons to share from similar experiences? 

tl;dr - My mum and I invited my girlfriend to live with us and after the new household dynamic didn't work out with my mum's mood swings and nasty behavior she verbally abused my girlfriend and threw her things onto the footpath so we moved out. Advice or similar experiences?"
relationships,"I (21F) have extreme jealousy issues with my boyfriend (22M) of two years, how can I fix it?","My boyfriend and I have been together almost 2 years and the biggest issue in our relationship is jealousy. I understand it’s normal for him to have other girl friends but it just makes me so upset, I don’t even want him to be friends with them. I really do love him but my jealousy issues are consuming me and ruining our relationship that I so badly want to fix. We also are in LDR so it makes my jealousy even worse. For example, he hung out with a couple guy friends the other night and one of his friends brought two girls over and I was angry and crying the whole night. It gets to the point where I threaten breaking up with him even though I know i don’t want to end things. My last boyfriend cheated on me twice with someone he referred to as “just a friend”. I also have very bad self esteem issues and we have broken up before so all that on top of LDR make me go crazy with jealousy. I want to fix that so if anyone has any tips on how to not get so crazy I’d really appreciate it! 

tl;dr - I have insane jealousy and trust issues with my boyfriend and I feel like I am slowly ruining our long distance relationship. How can I fix my jealousy issues to make our relationship happier and healthier?"
relationships,My Husband is Afraid of Tears,"My (34, f) husband (34, m) and I have been together for 5 years and married for 2. We get along great most of the time - few arguments, healthy disagreement resolution for the most part, etc. 

His biggest ‘area that needs improvement’ is that he doesn’t seem to know how to comfort me. When I cry (over anything other than a sappy movie) he gets visibly uncomfortable and makes THAT face (you know the one) of fear and confusion. This happens even if he isn’t the one making me cry. 

He will listen to me and hug me or give me a comforting rub on the back, but he doesn’t offer any verbal support or engage in any conversation/advice/supportive words. 

Now, I’m generally not someone who needs a lot of support but, like everyone, sometimes really shitty things happen and I need him to do more than hug me. 

Most recently I was diagnosed with a medical condition that effects our sex life and plans to conceive soon. I was having a BIG cry a couple of nights ago. He hugged me and listened to what I had to say but didn’t say anything back. I went to the bathroom to blow my nose and take some space from him b/c his reaction was making me more upset and when I came back he was asleep. 

This happens with other things too — for example both of my parents are just all around pieces of work and anytime I’m having an issue with them he has the same response. 

I want him to tell me it’s going to be ok, we’ll get through it together, ask questions, seem emotionally invested in my experiences. 

How do I help him help me? I think it just doesn’t come naturally to him to be comforting -  can he learn?

Tl;dr: My husband doesn’t know how to properly comfort me - how do I help him learn?

Edit: corrected typo “partners” to “parents”

Second edit: I understand the solution is to talk to him - hoping to hear from someone who has experienced either end of this about how I should approach it, how should I start the convo?"
relationships,What do you people who are in relationships even talk about everyday?,"I am 30 years old and I have never been in a relationship.

I don't talk much to people. I just lose myself in my hobbies. But in between activites, I do feel very lonely. But that sometimes confuses me. Am I longing for a relationship because I am horny or because my genes urge me to? Or is it because I want someone to talk to? But what would I talk about beyond a point? As I said, I am bad at talking. Most of the times, it irritates me. I just want to get back to doing what I wanted to do or had planned to.

I realize that if the person had 3-4 hobbies/interests/ideologies in common with me, I can probably talk for sometime.



Tl:dr Does it get boring beyond a point to talk to someone everyday, especially when you don't have common interests?"
relationships,"If my [22f] mom [42f] isn't the primary reason/inspiration why I'm doing something, she gets bratty.","She also gets like this if it's not her idea or if she overtakes something I'm doing to the point of where it becomes her thing not mine.

Mind you, I give credit where credit is due. If she was the reason or if she did inspire me, I acknowledge and constantly reasure it to high heavens. I'm talking about things that have little to nothing to do with her in my actions or decisions.

Sometimes it's not right when I'm doing something, like going out, creating, or working on something. Sometimes she just randomly brings it up later and pretty much acts like she's the primary reason I did something. When I admit she isn't she pretty much pulls the ""guilt trip, I'm the bad guy, you must hate me cards."" 

Mind you, one of the concepts she has EMPHASIZED while raising me is to not let people take over the things you do/want in life and to not take credit for something you had nothing to do with. When I respectfully discuss how she contradicts those concept she she tends to go into into an aggressive, pouty, sometimes crying fit and pulls out her cards.

Admittedly a majority of the problem is what I ALLOW people to do. There were countless times I caved in and ALLOWED her to frustratingly take over things that I wanted or had to be mine. School projects, stories, decisions to go out/stay, etc. But, in the past year and a half I haven't been allowing people's bullshit, hers included, and it's pissing her off. Up to the point of where she said, ""If I have to pretend to live in a world where my daughter loves me, so be it."" I think this was after I brought up how I didn't want to hang out with her co-workers because of college work I had to get done. There was a lot going on that night, though. I think it was a multitude of factors, tbh.

Half of the time I feel proudly justified in my stances but the the other half of the time I feel like I'm being ungreatful and mean.

TL;DR: My mom tends to get bratty if she's not the reason/inspiration for my actions, decisions, creations, etc., especially if they have nothing to do with her. That behaviour has increased since I haven't allowed her to be that way.

What do you guys think?? Any input is welcome."
relationships,Is it normal to have doubts in your relationship?,"I don’t know if I’m (24f) just expecting a fairytale romance. I have been with my boyfriend (27m) for about a year. Sometimes I worry that there could be someone better out there for me. I don’t mean this in a mean way. When we go out to eat, there’s barely any conversation besides me trying. I wonder if there is lacking chemistry. I keep having dreams about my ex (broke up almost 2 years ago, dated for 3 years). I was crazy about him and felt crazy in love, I don’t feel that with this one. Is it just a sign of more mature love since the other one was my first love? The man I am dating now is a good friend to me, but I don’t feel super crazy about him. I care about him a lot though and I would be really scared and sad to let that go. 

TL;DR - Need advice... worried there is a better match for me? Or am I too idealistic?"
relationships,I think my (30F) ex bf (31M) made a fake Instagram account to stalk me,"Over the weekend on Saturday an account called “@______memes” started following me on Instagram. I thought it was strange as their account was private, they had ZERO posts, 1 follower and was only following 40 people. As I was posting stories on my Instagram this  “@_____memes”  account was watching all of my stories within minutes of me posting them. 

I requested to follow the account but they never accepted my request. I also DMed them twice to ask if I knew who they were, which they read but never responded and left me on “seen.”

I started suspecting that it was my ex, as he and I were the only people who shared the specific humor of _____ type of memes together. 

I figured it could only be someone who knows me and is trying to keep tabs on my activity. I figured it could be my ex, as we unfollowed each other on Instagram BUT we never blocked each other either. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this before? Would someone really go through these lengths to keep tabs on their ex? 

Tldr; A suspicious private account started following me on Instagram and watches all my stories. I believe it could be my ex. Would someone really do this to keep tabs on their ex?"
relationships,My ex is continuously stalking my life and it is effecting my future.,"Me(25f) broke up with my ex(27m) in July 18’. It was a rough break up, for him. It was also a terrible relationship I couldn’t want to move on from. Now I think to myself what the hell was I thinking, but I can’t go back so.. After finally getting away from him I was bombarded with countless phone calls. Which turned into emails. I’m not sure how many different phone numbers AND emails I eventually blocked. They finally started to slow down, and towards the end of summer 19’ they finally began to stop. But then I faced myself in other situations. Social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc) I can’t have one and feel safe at the same time. I even tried to make one under a different name and was still found. Reddit is the only site I actually feel safe to be on. I was being watched at restaurants, at work, at the food store. Followed in the car. Even my dad was watched one day. This was a few months ago. 
I’m not sure what to do as I don’t exactly have proof (video, audio, ect) if my life being threatened so the local police won’t do anything. 
It’s to the point where I’m thinking about packing up and moving somewhere else. Except the only thing keeping me here is I don’t have much family, but the family I do have is here where I’m at now. 
I was hoping someone has went through something similar and has some kind of advice...

TL;DR I feel trapped in my town because my ex is stalking me. I need advice."
relationships,One of my (29/F) best and closest friends (29/F) is now dating my emotionally abusive ex (29/M) from five years ago knowing everything that he had put me through.,"If this were just a normal ex-boyfriend (one who hadn't emotionally abused me for years) I truly don't think I would care that my friend is dating him now. The thing is she was around for all of the abuse. I remember turning to her multiple times in the last year of that relationship and telling her everything that I had been holding in. She was there for me and she was supportive when I decided to seek help from a therapist. All of my friends were so good to me and so patient. I'll never forget that. 

I don't want to get into every little detail, but he basically isolated me from people, talked down to me in public and especially in private, punched holes in walls during arguments, left me on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere without my phone because I had asked if we could grab sushi instead of pub food on our way to a date once, always found new and cruel ways to let me know how ugly and undesirable I was, etc. 

This one time he was talking down to me at a restaurant, loud enough that another couple intervened. I was asked by the girl if I was okay and I remember just putting on a smile and nodding even though I had tears rolling down my face. Although that wasn't the worst thing that he had ever put me through, it sticks out a lot because it showed me that I didn't deserve what he was doing to me and that even a random passerby could see how miserable I had become. 

Anyway we broke up later that year and I got my life together. Now at 29, I've moved on. But of course I still struggle with some of the things that he had put in my head. I had no idea my friend was dating him until a week ago. Our friend group had scheduled a video chat. I noticed him in the background at her house, casually grabbing something from her kitchen before she gave him a look as though to tell him to move out of the shot. It was quick but I saw it and she could tell because she contacted me the following day to let me know what was going on. 

Although I respect the fact that she addressed it, I still don't get how or why someone could ever date the person that had pushed their friend so far over the edge. I would never so much as befriend a guy or girl who had hurt someone close to me, let alone date them. Even if he is a changed person (which she said he is) that doesn't change what he did. There are so many other guys out there that she could date. Why him? Maybe I'm being unreasonable, I just feel that it's a shitty thing to do as a friend. 

Not sure how to approach the situation or what to do moving forward in terms of our friendship. This guy basically tried to kill me once. We were arguing (more like he was shouting at me and I was taking it) in his car once and he started speeding down a busy street running through red lights saying that he wasn't going to slow down or stop until I apologized for having spoken up about something. That is the kind of guy we're dealing with here. Although he could very well have changed and grown to be a better person, those experiences and those memories don't just fade. Not for me. 

I don't even know what to say to her. Apparently they've been together since Christmas and he's been quarantining with her at her house. My main concern is her safety. What if he hasn't changed? He was good at pretending at the start and then when he felt comfortable enough the emotional abuse began and stayed throughout.  

How do I go about this? 

Thoughts?

TL;DR She knows he was emotionally abusive and she was there for me throughout, but five years later she's dating him and I honestly have no words. What does this mean in terms of our friendship? How do I handle this? I'm shocked by her decision but also concerned for her safety."
relationships,"I (23M) and my gf (23M) have been together for 1.5 yrs. And for the past few month, we are non stop fighting.","Note: Its my first relationship

So basically, in the last 8 months we have broke off our relationship about 5 times, but we always get back together. The problem is she stalks if I am online or not and if ditched a message, and even though some fucked ip glitches or whatever shows that I was online while I wasn't, she doesn't believe and simply believes lets say fb messenger. Another issue is she doesnt want me to PM any girls as she feels that means something can happen between me and another girl. And also she always uses an attitude where she refuses to say the same thing twice and doesn't forgive/believe that I forget a lot, like she may tell me that she has some sort of ddl and then when K forget the ddl its like I dont care. And when there are issues that I see very minute and I am like please lets fight about a minute issue, like maybe me texting a girl without telling her, she flips crazy.

I tried to make her happy and she demanded more. Then I requested that whatever she requests applies to her as well to make her feel how I feel. And now, she uses a really bad attitude with me because I simply find her constantly upset and I feel like I am drained and dont know what to do with her to make her simply happy. And after every fight I wont forget this, I wont forget that, I dont understand whether she doesnt want to move forward or what does she want.

And I asked her if she wants to break up and she says no, I love you!!

I simply ask this:
1. What should I do to convey with her all the issues in manner that she accepts?
2. Should indulge that she keeps getting upset about every tiny thing?
3. Am I treating the lady incorrectly?

TL;DR my girlfriend is constantly upset and she doesnt want to break up. Its draining me, but I love her and dont want to break her heart. Am I misunderstanding something that is screwing everything up? Or are we simply not a match?"
relationships,I (25M) am moving away from my girlfriend (29F) and the anticipation of a breakup is hurting both of us.," 

Hey all,

I moved to the city back in January for a new job, and started dating my girlfriend in late February. Due to COVID-19, I got laid off on the 1st of this month. When I took my job I'd intended to remain in that field for an extended period of time (and subsequently remain in the city I'm in now). My girlfriend helped me work through a lot of issues both professionally and personally, and motivated me to make the decision to go back to school to do things I love.

To elaborate on my situation: living where I do now is *incredibly* expensive. While I am able to cover my living costs until my lease is up (in August), it would be difficult to find another job I can do that both allows me to pay for my living expenses while saving for school. My parents have offered to let me move back in with them more or less rent free and save up money so that I'll be able to afford school. As a result, I'm planning on moving across the country to live with them at the end of August.

Here's our problem: We love each other, but cannot do long-distance. We've discussed this/the fact that it's likely we'll break up, and that we should enjoy what time we have left together. However, almost every conversation feels like it's dominated by the topic of me leaving. It comes up in half the conversations we have, and it brings us both down. It's brought us both to tears more than once, and made both of us physically ill. I'm worried that we're making things worse by staying together in spite of everything that's going to happen.  


tl;dr I'm moving in August, and feel like delaying breaking up with my girlfriend is adversely affecting both our mental health."
relationships,My boyfriend [23M] for 2 years says that a voice in his head tells him that he doesn’t actually love me [22F].,"
Hi Reddit, this is going to be a long one. I apologize if the format is all scrambled because I’m crying so much I can’t think straight.

Today started off such a good day — we woke up and he kissed me good morning. We spent the whole day together laughing and teasing each other, having fun. Now all of a sudden I feel like my world has been shattered. 

2 hours ago he randomly said “we have to talk” and sat me on the bed. He says that he’s having strange thoughts in his head (he said it’s like a tiny “voice”) that tells him he doesn’t TRULY love me, and that he’s just with me because he can’t bare to see me lonely. He said that the voice tells him that he’s lying to me and that we should break up.

I’m so shocked. I asked him what he meant by that because he’s always told me he loved me? Were those all lies? Why would he feel like that? He said that it doesn’t happen to him always but when he’s alone in thought, that voice comes back and tells him that he’s lying to me, that he’s only with me because he’s scared he won’t find someone better. He says he argues with the voice and says that he DOES love me and he would do anything for me, but it always comes back and haunts him and he’s not sure how to keep it from me anymore. 

He said that he might be feeling this way because I’m his first girlfriend and he’s inexperienced with what “love” is supposed to feel like. He always thought it would be jitters and butterflies and nerves, but he said he’s never felt that way with me. He just feels “comfortable” and safe. He also said that although he feels the happiest he’s ever been with me, he still feels like there’s a hole inside of him. He said that what he feels with me is so different from what it’s like in the 
movies, he ends up questioning himself. 

He says he doesn’t want to break up and he just wanted to let me know that he had these thoughts but he would never act on it. He wanted ME to validate his thoughts and he asked me if I ever felt like he didn’t love me, and that if I ever felt like he was “hiding something”. I said no... and he seemed to feel better and more reassured that his feelings for me were real.

I’m just so confused on what to do. I feel like crap because now that I think back on all of our memories, I’m haunted by the image that when he looks at me deep in the eyes, he’s not looking at me with love, he’s questioning whether not he loves me. I don’t know how much of our relationship he was faking being happy. I don’t know how common this feeling that he has is either, or if this questioning is normal. I don’t want to be the person validating my boyfriends feelings for me... Are these thoughts potentially a mental illness? Or is he actually lying to himself that he loves me? Can this even be fixed with couples therapy?

I don’t know how to move on from this talk. I think that we should probably break up, but I don’t want to mistakenly break up with him in case he actually does love me, but is just blinded by “TV love” or by inexperience. I always thought he did love me from his actions... 

Please help reddit. Is this relationship worth staying in? 

TLDR; Boyfriend says that voice in his head haunts him and tells him that he doesn’t love me. He feels it’s because he always thought he’d get butterflies with his gf, but he never has them with me. We’ve never had any problems these past 2 years and I’ve always felt that he loved me. Should we break up? Is this a sign of a hidden mental illness?"
relationships,I've been with my (f18) girlfriend (f18) for five months now but a part of me likes my best friend even though I have a heck lot of feelings for my girlfriend.,"I've been with my girlfriend for five months now (known each other for almost an year) We're in a long distance relationship, she's from the USA and I'm somewhere from Asia. It's not easy since our time zones are messed up and we only get the chance to talk with each other when it's night for me and day for her. 

The past few months had been crazy for both of us. We almost broke up, stopped talking for almost an month cause she thought we had broken up. 

Let's go like two months back where there was no communication between us two, even when there was it was all one sided. Me trying to communicate with her and she would takes days to reply and sometimes even weeks. It all started when she met this girl at the club and they hit it off, she would say they're close friends but sometimes I would feel insecure well because she would spend more time with her friend than she would with me in a whole week. Honestly I've never had any problem with her going out with her friends or hanging out with them, but it got to the point where we would spend no time together. I never asked her to give me all of her time and attention but just the bare minimum. 

So somewhere between the arguments she said she doesn't know what she wants anymore and disappeared again. I got tired of waiting around for her, losing my sleep every night and I decided to leave her a text saying that we should just end it if she isn't sure about what she wants anymore. After an week later I get a reply from her saying something like ""Are you serious?"" followed by another text from her friend (the one she met at the club) saying how my girlfriend came to her place drunk and passed out, we got into an argument about how i broke up with my girlfriend and that if I really loved her I would have waited for her. I really didn't mind waiting for her but I needed a reason back then to keep holding on to her and I never had any. I was left in the dark with no explaination or anything at all. So during the argument with her friend, she tells me how my girlfriend was hospitalised but she never really told me anything about her being hospitalised? Her friend even said how she doubts my girlfriend would talk to me again and that's she's already moved on.

So I was moving on and trying to go on with my life, and things were going well with me and the girl I liked? I've liked her for months since me and my girlfriend we're dating but i disregarded those feelings as an attraction between friends but oh boy I was so wrong, as we started getting closer and getting to know each other more I realized how my feelings were deeper for her than and I really wasn't expecting anything from her since we both were going through a lot with our past relationships but I went ahead and confessed my feelings for her but it wasn't mutual. She said how she can't have feelings for me or anyone at all and can't imagine herself being in a relationship for a really long time, not that i was expecting one but I wanted to know if we're on the same page. 

So of course we're still friends. After an whole month my ""girlfriend""? Texts me and apologies for how things ended between us two, we kind of talk about the whole thing that happened and how she really loves me alot and that she was confused if we're still together or not, to which I reply truthfully and tell her that we never broke up and I never wanted to but she just assumed and went on with her life without talking to me for a minute. She also tells me how she hooked up with someone cause she thought we had ""broken up"" and she expected me to mad at her but honestly I was just really disappointed and hurt over everything so after a whole week of talking we're back to how we used to be. 

A part of me still likes my friend, but I've accepted that I'll never be anything to her more than a friend but my friends say otherwise and talk about how she has feelings for me but not enough feelings to be in a relationship with me, but i feel like an asshole for still talking with her and being with my girlfriend.

TL;DR: I like my friend despite being in a relationship."
relationships,Is it possible?,"I (22F) have been friends with this guy (22M) since we were probably 18 or so. We’re not the best of friends but I’d say we’re pretty close. But ever since I met him, I’ve always had this gut feeling about us being together. However, that has never happened and we’ve never done anything even slightly romantic mainly because when I wanted to make a move when we had first met, he ended up going out with one of our mutual friends. As far as I’m aware, they’ve been on and off for years now so I just kinda kept my feelings buried away cuz I love knowing he’s my friend and someone I can talk to. But my feelings about us being together haven’t changed or gone away. We don’t talk every single day or anything but he has visited me at school and we hang out when we can. I actually even asked him to go to my senior prom with me but something happened and he ended up having to bail. Still don’t know if he just wanted a way out but that’s in the past. So now, it’s like 4 years later and I still have these feelings but I don’t know if I should confess. I don’t know if he’s still seeing that mutual friend or ours and I also don’t know if risking the friendship is worth it.

TL;DR - I don’t know if I should risk it and possibly ruin my friendship with my guy friend and tell him I’ve had feelings for him for a while but never said anything about it since he had a girlfriend when I wanted to tell him. Not sure if he is still with said girlfriend."
relationships,"Sexual harassment, manipulation and friendship in the workplace.","I'm a 30M bartender who hasn't been in a relationship since 2012. I haven't had sex since then either, plenty of opportunities just living conditions and honestly fear from abstaining for so long is a factor. Anyone the majority of my close coworkers are female servers/bartenders. Most of the cooks are male but I don't interact with them as closely. No time to small talk with the kitchen as much as the servers. 

Anyone who has worked in a restaurant knows that some level of sexual harassment is just part of the culture. The long term employees that have been working with each other for years are always saying dirty shit to each other. One of my closest coworkers is a 23F that is engaged to a former cook and has a child with him. I've always liked her and she knows it, unfortunately when I was younger and she was more or less single and fucking around I was a coward and never went after her. Of course years later she told me I should have  tried harder. 

We have a really strange relationship because we are essentially just close friends but she will grab my ass and rub up on me. I never touch her sexually because I'm not about that life but I've definitely told her straight to her face the shit I'd do to her and she plays along. She knows I want to fuck her and deep down in side I think there is some attraction to me too. I wrote a hilarious short story using inside jokes and sexual undertones about her and she told me she read it 4 times and she couldn't tell if she was wet from pissing herself laughing or being turned on. Whenever I see her out with just her baby she says shit like this could have been your daddy.

But she is loyal to her man and I would never want to fuck that up. I lost weight and gained some muscle and she told me I'm so much hotter when I'm confident. I even lent her some money for Christmas, that she paid me back. But not before she cut me a deal to give me some nudes in exchange to knock some of the cash down... this is wear the manipulation comes in. I've definitely manipulated other coworkers into giving me stuff like that. Some of them literally for free, and all of them in relationships. It makes me feel like a terrible person but my this told me the reason women do it is because I make them feel good about themselves. She told me they ""enjoy"" my sexual harassment. Which seems like a pretty slippery slope but it might be true. I don't give a fuck about their stretch marks, or weight or whatever I just tell them straight to their face they look great and eventually they are willing to show me. 

The problem with all this is now I don't know how to talk to single women anymore. It feels weird, like I would rather talk to my married coworker with 3 kids than a single girl who wants to fuck me. Not to mention my workplace might be just a unique environment, I could quit and go somewhere else and instantly get fired and catch a charge. So I guess the question is what do I do with my coworker, just keep it moving and stay friends and try to tone down my bullshit? How do I learn to talk to single women?

 TL;DR Female coworker is engaged with a kid but I am really close friends with her and she grabs my ass/rubs up on me and I verbally sexually harass her back but she tells me she enjoys it. I have manipulated nudes from other coworkers in relationships as well just by being nice to them and telling them they look good. Unsure of how to proceed/talk to actually single women."
relationships,My girlfriend (22f) is unmotivated and it is beginning to get on my (34m) nerves,"We have been together four years next week.

I do love my girlfriend but she doesn’t really ever do anything. I think a lack of motivation and lots of procrastination is her issue. This has been the case since we began dating but I thought it was because of her age that she was this way. She is late to graduating college, takes two naps a day, and has issues with focus. When I come home I usually expect her to have dinner ready but often she has forgotten to cook and winds up apologizing. I’ve talked about it with her before on many occasions and it seems like she has gotten the message but it keeps happening over and over again. I know she is 22 but I feel as though she should have more energy for her age.
I’m at a loss at what to do to get her motivated and need help.
tdlr:
Girlfriend has issues with focus and forgets things often to the point where I’m irritated with her"
relationships,I think my (25f) dad (44m) is in an abusive marriage with his wife (42f) of 15-ish years,"First off, my paternal grandparents raised me most of my childhood and I lived with my dad and his wife for only about 3 years (12-15ish) and I ended up living with my grandparents again afterwards mostly because of how badly she treated me, I never felt part of the family and felt like the odd one out since I was the step-kid. It was me, my dad, and then her and her two kids plus the kid they had together. So I was the only one without a blood tie to the rest of the family unit aside from my dad. I’m only just realizing the way she treated me when I was a kid wasn’t just unfair and bad, it was abusive.

My husband (30m) works with my dad at the same company and has been for about 5 years, so they are close friends at this point and talk quite often. My dad has been very stressed out lately, more than usual and he’s a really private person but will open up to my husband sometimes. My dad has been stressed out about finances and I guess his budget is way out of whack. Like $1800 food budget for 3 people a month crazy, not to mention all the other expenses they have. My husband was flabbergasted that we actually have more bills than they do and they have more income a month than we do, yet we have more extra at the end of each month. My dads wife just buys crap constantly and I guess if he tries sitting down and talking about it she will throw a temper tantrum and break things so he just avoids talking to her about stuff. And I remember her flipping over a coffee table before, threw something through the TV screen once, she threw her laptop like a frisbee down the hallway and they are hardwood floors so it shattered and broke. They can’t have nice plates, only plastic ones, because she throws them at the wall. So I guess she still does that stuff all these years later. 

Now my dads side of the family used to get together a lot. My grandparents, my uncle and his family, me and my family unit and then my dad and that whole family. But now my dad has no relationship with his brother because of some drama between them and his wife and my dad hardly has a relationship with his mom for unknown reasons. His excuse is that her house reminds him of his brother so he gets too mad so he just never sees her hardly anymore unless he needs to borrow money. Which they borrowed $2000 from her recently to avoid foreclosure on their house because they can’t pay their bills. My grandma told me this and my dad doesn’t know I know. She feels used for her money because they only paid half of it back and was venting to me about it. Which makes me mad because I know my dads wife just bought a used Wii and a brand new switch Lite just a few weeks ago for the daughter they have together who is like 13ish now.. But it made me realize she might be manipulating him into being distant from his own family because she’s been mad at me before and he hardly saw me or his newborn granddaughter for 2 years until just recently. My daughter is 3 so they missed out on her life from age 1 and most of year 2. My dad pretty much has no close family left because they’ve been alienated from him because she starts drama and doesn’t allow anyone to reconcile. I’m the only one she’s been unable to chase away for good probably due to the fact my husband and my dad work together, and because me and my dad are avid video game players so we talk in PSN chat almost daily. To successfully alienate me he’d have to get a different job (which he’s actually trying to do) and he’d have to quit his favorite hobby of playing video games which is the only thing keeping him sane right now I think. She’s super close with her family but to hell with my dad’s family apparently.

I hate seeing my dad so stressed out and anxious all the time. I wish I knew what to do and I’m angry this is happening. But I feel like since this is his 3rd marriage now he just puts up with it because he doesn’t want to deal with a custody battle again like he did with me my whole childhood. What can I even say to him? Is there anything I can do?

TLDR: I’m concerned my dad is in an abusive marriage with his wife who recklessly spends money to the point they might foreclose on their house, but when he tries to sit down and talk civilly about it with her she throws a temper tantrum and will break things in their house and yell at him so now he avoids talking about important things with her and is living with crippling anxiety and stress and is almost completely alienated from his family at this point. How can I help my dad and is there anything I can do?"
relationships,"We’re (35M and 28F) fine when we’re alone, but socialising with anyone causes huge problems","TL;DR

Hopefully it’s ok to begin with a summary.

Ok, so that title immediately screams abuse. It is however rather more complicated and I really need some direction. I love this girl very much, I want a future with her, and I really want all of our issues to be mine so that I can get a handle on it, take responsibility and deal with each issue accordingly.

As things stand, we are in a toxic cycle. I feel my girlfriend is involuntarily manipulative, she may have BPD, she struggles to take responsibility, she is quite amazingly indecisive and constantly cycling between blaming me for everything, love bombing me and blaming herself. When we argue, she will often stonewall.

I am certainly not perfect. After an abusive childhood I have a temper, clinical depression, I’m needy and suffer bouts of low self esteem. After months of therapy a few years back I’ve got a handle on a lot of my own failings and can better manage my behaviour, but there’s no magic bullet.

In 18 months together, she has broken up with me during an argument 10 times. After each discard, she either apologises profusely or I do and plead with her to stay. I must admit, I am terrified of not having her in my life because when we are connected and close, it is the best relationship I’ve ever had. We understand each other so well, we care for one another, we make each other happy, and in her words “we are bestest friends”. I don’t want this to be another relationship that didn’t work out, I want there to be solutions, but I’m not sure there are healthy ones.

I’m going to break this down somewhat into bitesized chunks of crazy.

Some background:

My girlfriend and I met in September 2018. I’d not long left a relationship and was still dealing with my ex girlfriends drama. I wasn’t ready to start a relationship, but we text one another most days after an initial meet. We’d make each other laugh so much and genuinely didn’t think we were good enough for the other. We didn’t actually start dating until January 2019, but quickly got as close as we thought we would and things progressed very well.

She was living 60 miles away with her parents, I have my own house (that I’m in the process of renovating completely). We are both educated and experienced, she has a professional career and I’m freelance. She was desperate to move out and create some independence from her parents whom she described as ostentatious, overbearing and in the case of her mother, a manipulative little Hitler who’d lost touch with her first two children (she has 4) during a marital separation (there is a significant age gap between the siblings, and my girlfriend has never met them). It became apparent that her mother had held her back from pursuing university, and quite clearly had held on to her youngest daughter way longer than was reasonable. My girlfriend justified staying with them for so long (I moved out at 18 so to me, it’s unusual) because they had a huge house, and she was trying to save for a mortgage.

We fell in love, and as the months went by, she naturally began moving in with me. She found her commute to work from my place wasn’t quite as bad as she expected and she enjoyed living in the countryside location my house sits in. She didn’t impose herself, I was delighted to have her join me.

We got along well, cooked together, ate together almost every night, watched movies, walked for miles in the hills, we took a break away to go and visit my brother a few hundred miles away. We were a proper couple, and saw one another as ‘the one’.

Early summer 2019, the problems began. She had already warned me that she could become emotionally detached when other people important to her were in her company. She told me that she struggled to keep everyone close at the same time, and focussed quite intently on who she was with at that moment. This warning was given whilst en route to meet the only sister she has a relationship with. We met her at her parents house, and very quickly I could see my girlfriend withdraw from me and almost change to suit her sister’s personality. She became more brash, opinionated, materialistic. It was quite striking, I’d seen this before in an ex (I understand is known as mirroring?). That very evening, there was a disagreement during a political conversation and very quickly my girlfriend leapt to the defence of her sister, putting me down in the process and belittling my views. Rather odd, I hadn’t seen this before in her. Perhaps it was my fault for mentioning such a controversial subject. We discussed it days later and she agreed it was unreasonable of her. I told her that I needed more respect from her when in the company of others (acutely aware of her mother’s manipulative tendencies I didn’t want any vulnerabilities exposed in that household in particular), and we left it at that.

Friends:

She was invited to a ‘best’ friend’s wedding, and it seemed to be the only thing on her mind for what felt like months. There were two hen dos, one of which was abroad, dress fittings, meals out to plan, and the actual wedding itself. I wasn’t invited.

And then there was another friend’s wedding, this time she stayed over with me at one of my friend’s houses in town to be near to the venue. I wasn’t invited.

Parties, meals out, evenings in town, I wasn’t invited to any of it. We have been together for 18 months now and I’ve met her primary group of friends twice, once during a planned ‘introduction’ at a bar when we got together and again on her birthday in November. None of her friends have ever been to our house. It has left me baffled, and I feel like such an embarrassment to her. She has argued “that’s just how my friends are”, and I have argued “yes, but you are responsible for your interactions too”. Conversely, I have introduced her to everyone I know. She’s a popular figure in my village pub, has become friends with the friends I have here (I moved into this region 5 years ago so most of my social contacts are 350 miles away) and met those further afield during trips back ‘home’ with me.

One of her social engagements involved staying at her parents for the weekend whilst they were on holiday. We went to her parents house together and she then went out to see her friends, leaving me to sit for her parents dogs. By this point I was really beginning to feel left out and forgotten. We text one another that evening as she became progressively more inebriated before eventually telling me she was sick of me texting her, “my friends don’t have to constantly text their boyfriends when we’re all out. I can’t deal with your anxiety”. She then immediately ended the relationship with me over the phone whilst I begged her to be reasonable. She got a taxi back, blaming me for ending her night early, and on her arrival at the house shouted at me repeatedly whilst quite clearly still very drunk. Some of the highlights:

“You’re controlling”
“You’re making my life miserable”
“This level of anxiety isn’t normal, I can’t deal with it”
“Maybe I want someone else”

I sat there crying in bed, trying to work out why this person who loved me intensely 12 hours prior now wanted to have me surgically removed from her life as if I was some sort of tumour. I had every intention of getting my things together and driving home the next morning.

However when we wake, she apologises profusely. She didn’t excuse any of her actions and admitted she couldn’t treat me like this again, that she was desperate for another chance and pleaded with me not to end the relationship (that she ended the evening prior). She blamed alcohol for her emotional instability, and immediately swore to give up drinking. I suggested this was a major undertaking and perhaps just try moderating it, but she refused and said she doesn’t know how to.

Her sobriety lasted a few weeks, before admitting she isn’t going to stick to it and it was an overreaction of her to suggest this. Instead, she agreed not to drink around friends when we weren’t together as I am able to moderate her drinking for her when we’re together (her words). Come the next night out without me, naturally she drank and completely undermined her voluntary commitment to me. She denied drinking until the moment I picked her up and smelt it on her breath. Her excuse for not admitting this earlier (when we were texting intermittently throughout the night) was that I’d be angry with her. It caused a huge row.

Autumn:

Come November, we were asked to spend the whole month at her parents house to dog sit whilst they travelled Australia. I work from a laptop and her parents house is actually closer to work, so it didn’t inconvenience us too much. It was quite an upheaval and I must admit I find such change difficult to deal with, but it was temporary at least. As the weeks went by, she surprised me on the phone one evening during her drive back from work by telling me “I can’t treat you like I have any longer, I want to get help. I’m going to get therapy”, which of course I welcomed. I insisted that our issues were not all of her doing, that we each had a responsibility to solve our collective issues, but she insisted everything stemmed from her. I didn’t agree, and still don’t, but I welcomed her enthusiasm to seek some much needed support.

For the second time in our relationship, I was invited to spend the day with her and her friends to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. We went out for pizza, and conversation flowed between everyone until her ‘best friend’ (she has two) asked her “do you fancy a Nando’s in the week?” to which my girlfriend immediately responded with “sounds great!”. Now, this wouldn’t be out of the ordinary at all, if it wasn’t for the fact that I was staying with her at her parents place all month to dog sit. This would mean leaving me to it for the evening whilst she heads off to socialise with friends that are quite obviously not particularly interested in getting to know me. It struck me as really rude. Later that evening I asked her about this and she immediately responded with “oh I’m not going, I just didn’t want an argument”. Why on earth would saying “no” and reiterating the circumstances that they were already fully aware of or perhaps even suggesting “can my boyfriend come?” cause an argument?

We spent the immediate Christmas period with her parents. It wasn’t particularly enjoyable and the atmosphere was tense. We argued when away from family members fairly constantly. We drove down to see my family 350 miles away after Christmas, and the bickering was mostly non-stop. On our way home after new year, she reneged on her voluntary obligation to seek help, told me it was all my fault, that I made her feel that it was her fault, that it’s actually all my fault and I’m the one who needs help. She accused me of being manipulative and controlling.

Disney:

Her parents have been excitedly reminiscing about  Disneyworld holidays they had as a family right up until a couple of years ago. They asked if I would go, and insisted they’d pay for everything. I wasn’t comfortable with it especially, as the thought of spending two weeks with them fills me with dread. Furthermore, it felt rather odd that they’d take a 35 year old to such a place without children and at their expense. My girlfriend was desperate for us to accept the offer, so over lunch one day and in front of her parents, she mentioned it once again, knowing I’d have to accept.

This was scheduled for September 2020, but has been postponed a year due to the pandemic (thank god).

Lockdown:

We struggled through until March, when she ended the relationship whilst on a walk at the beach. She was tired of me talking about coronavirus, argued my suggestion that she should insist on working from home was controlling, and went on a tirade about how I don’t allow her independence. She told me that I am stopping her from seeing friends, family, that I’ve taken her away from her life, and I’m trying to turn her against her parents. I sat down and sobbed as I watched her turn on her heels and morph into the cold and heartless version of herself that seems to hate everything about me. We agreed to leave the beach and drove home. She packed her things and left. On her way to her parents, I called her and apologised for talking about the upcoming pandemic too often and tried to rationalise all of the arguments had about friends and family. I was freaking out and deeply afraid of losing her forever. She went from being very cold and distant to emotionally aware in a couple of minutes. It was agreed she’d come back and we’d try to find compromises that work for us, and that she’d have more independence, which translated means she’s going to see her friends and family more often and I will not be included. I’m not sure why she wanted this to be the case, she is my world and I want her to be included in my life fully.

Coronavirus takes hold and the UK gradually becomes one of the worst affected countries in the world. Lockdown happens, she is forced to work from home. Fast forward two and a half months and we’ve had the most peaceful period of our relationship to date. We have been getting on so well, we feel close, there’s very little to argue about (whilst the world is still a very stressful and scary place), we have no real qualms. We’ve been working on the garden together, watching movies, enjoying the sun, exercising and having a generally pleasant life. It is quite the opposite of most people’s experiences.

Today, we met her parents for the first time in months. Despite their desire to come over to the house, we insisted on abiding by the law and met them instead in a park halfway and would socially distance for the duration. The meet went initially quite well despite my girlfriend’s anxiety about their commitment to social distancing (she is now taking the pandemic very seriously), but I felt belittled toward the end. I mentioned that I wasn’t happy with a garden project I’ve been working on and said “I don’t want it to be perfect, but cottage like...” and my girlfriend interjected with “it’s not going to be perfect, hahaha”, giving her mother the opportunity to retort “well no it’s not going to be if you’re doing it yourself”. It felt completely uncalled for, especially since I take such pride in my work and have been working on property for my whole adult life. This particular property has become my career during lockdown since all of my clients have suspended operations. When I questioned my girlfriend about her retort on our way home, she immediately accused me of being over sensitive and refused to admit that she’d done anything wrong. She denied hearing what her mother said. That was 6 hours ago and I have kept myself busy since getting home, occasionally asking my girlfriend if she understands why what was said was hurtful, she has so far told me “I’m not going to apologise, it wasn’t meant to hurt you and you were over sensitive if it did. You were bound to be offended by something today”. I even went so far as to text her a link to a psychology site discussing why telling someone they’re over sensitive is unhelpful, but she refused to read it. I feel undermined, belittled and as if I have no recourse. I guess we’re back to square one."
relationships,My mother wants me to take an online class for her.,"
My mom recently started taking online college courses. Yesterday she told me that I have to work on a assignment for her yesterday and I did it. After talking to her for a bit, she told me that she wanted me to take the whole class for her. I tried to tell her that I was kinda uncomfortable with this...... But she kinda brushed me off. This is sorta something she’s done as long as I can remember. Today she was fuming at me today for not working on her math work. There was other things she was upset with me about (my room being dirty, cooking the same food etc) but that was the biggest thing. I don’t really have anyone to talk about with this and I clearly don’t want to do this. But I’m scared she might retaliate in some other way. I’m really unsure about what I should do.... I’m 20 and with the whole pandemic there’s not a whole lot I can do right now.

TLDR: My mom wants me to take a online class for her. I don’t really feel comfortable with doing this."
relationships,One Year Anniversary Gifts (20M) (19F),"One Year Anniversary Ideas

Hi there,

I’ve been with my girlfriend a year come the first and I’m looking at creating some special gifts. I have already ordered some physical presents but some hand made gifts would be lovely.

Please drop any ideas for loved ones that I can base my ideas around for example a time line of all our important dates for example.

I know this is a personal question and only I should know what’s special between myself and my partner but some prompts never hurt anyone.

Thank you

relationships,[22/M] My Head or My Heart?? A Quarantine Love Dilemma,"          Ladies and Gentleman I am currently in quite an emotionally taxing situation. I was in a long term relationship from High School till January of this year when me and this girl, we’ll call her J, broke up.Me and J have quite a complicated history,for example, we’ve broken up multiple times, I’ve been assaulted by her ex boyfriend, she has mental illness related issues which in the past have effected me, and I’m not proud of myself, but in the past I cheated on her... a lot... I was pretty much a sex addict and used sex as a coping mechanism for a lot of my problems( BOO,awful I know).But anyway in December I finally decided to clean up my act for myself and J so I spoke to a councillor, got a referral to a psychologist, and began talking to my friends about my problems. However it was too late and by January her trust in me and mine in her was broken beyond repair and alas as I stated earlier, me and her split. 

          Classic Break up I know but just wait because now it’s about to get a little Spicier 🌶. Time passes and as I’m talking with my friends and accepting and working through my issues, I eventually feel that I’m ready to date someone without hurting them with my dirty rotten disgusting cheating, and I begin dating this girl, she’ll be called M. M Is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, with a literal 4.0 GPA and aspirations and goals that I could only dream of. She’s also been one of my biggest supports throughout everything I’ve went through and I honestly don’t think I’d be where I am today without her. However because of COVID-19 she moved back to her home town and I moved back too mine and we live REALLY REALLY far away. 

          This is when it turns into a ghost pepper 👻🌶. Throughout all this time I haven’t spoken to J, not even once , and then finally, a few weeks ago, me and her end up having a few brief conversations, she tells me she’s just started seeing a new dude, and she already knew about me and M. These conversations are entirely harmless in nature of course, however, since I’ve talked to her again I’ve felt my feelings for J grow and grow and now I truly don’t know what to do. I think about J constantly, I think of how I want her back ,how I wish I could have 1 more chance because now I know I’m in a place where we could make it work and I could treat her right. Idk if I should tell J how I feel or not, would it be fair to her to say these things when she’s started a new relationship? And what about M? She’s been instrumental in getting me to where I am today but my heart feels as if it’s screaming for J , and I feel as if ending things with her will break her heart, and if J doesn’t reciprocate my feelings, breaking up with M could leave me completely alone. This is my Quarantine Dilemma and I would really appreciate some help figuring it out, or at the very least, some honest advice about what to do

TL:DR. I’ve moved back to my hometown do to COVID and my feelings for an ex-girlfriend have returned and I feel as though I truly love her and want to be with her. However she has just started a new relationship and I am in a relationship of my own"
relationships,Reoccurring disagreement with best friend (23m) and I (22f)- not showing enough interest in common hobbies.,"I (22f) am feeling  a little frustrated lately over the same situation that has reoccurred with my best guy friend(23m).  (We known each other 8+ years - non romantic,  he is my best friend). It is a piggy back off a thread I posted a while back about my friend thinking that i am not truly interested in few games or interests we have in common . Sounds childish but bare with me

One in particular is DnD-
We’ve been preparing to start a campaign; getting our characters ready, creating  the backgrounds etc but since then we haven’t played. So we agreed to play one morning but we both ended up sleeping in, leaving us with not enough time to play before we had to head out to work. 

Apparently this left a sour taste in his mouth and him expressing that he feels as though there isn’t / I’m not showing enough interest in playing the game, I say that I am but my actions don’t match because we haven’t played our campaign yet and procrastinating. 
if I truly wanted to play then it would of happened already whether it be the morning we had made plans or another time.   He also expressed he feels as though he is always the initiator in wanting play or to do something in relation to the game.  

So now he refuses to have any association with me in regards to DnD. 

I understand being let down when plans fall through , it happens and  that’s always a bummer so I get where he’s coming from in that sense.  I am hurt of what he said in regards to procrastinating or me being uninterested- I am very interested otherwise I wouldn’t be spending time buying,  building my character and other materials for our campaign etc .  
I will admit there are times where we could have played and didn’t. Majority of those times we would of only been able to play for an hour or two, which I expressed to him i didn’t feel that was enough time but he sees it as an excuse.    As for initiating yes i will take fault in not asking/bringing up more often. 
Anyways the whole thing is off the table. 

I don’t know how to show him or express to him that I am truly interested and I would still like to play with him.  If I ask him now he will say no or that I’m only doing because he mentioned something.  I hate to bring his GF into this story but the same situation happened with her and him,  funny enough over DnD too, but he still will play with her regardless.   

To a lot people it may seem like it’s just a game get over it and move on , but it something I (we) we’re for some time looking forward to start so it’s disappointing. 

Should I just let go and revisit it further in time?
Or talk to him?  Any helpful advice?

Thanks for reading! 

Td:lr  friend refuses to play or associate anything in regards to a certain game because he feels as there is no interest on my part. -I am interested."
relationships,Dealing with my roommate's threatening BF,"Background: I'm a 25 yr old M and my roommate is a 30 year old M. We moved in last July and haven't really had any direct confrontational problems. We don't talk at all, and I can't stand his mess but I just keep quiet and clean up after him because I ultimately know he won't clean up. Our lease is up in about a month, and my plan was to move out and into my own unit in the same building but those plans are on pause because of COVID-19.

Anyways, he always has hookups over. I don't care, as long as they are clean and neat, because it is his space too and he pays rent and can have people over as he please. This guy stayed over last night and is still here right now. I went out to the store and came back and his suitcase was blocking the door, and I accidentally kicked it. He came out and cussed me out, screaming at me not to touch his stuff. When I told him it was in the way, he just kept screaming. I go to my room to do some work, and I hear him in the background telling my roommate ""catch me outside any f\*\*\*ing day because you need to be straightened out"",""I bet you stay in that f\*\*\*ing room until I leave"", ""don't call the police on me because I have friends in the police and they let me get away with this sh\*t"". He then told my roommate how ""if you ever have a problem with him to text me and I'll finish the job"" and ""you should put cameras in the hallway up so you can catch him messing with your stuff"". The messing with your stuff part is odd because I've never touched his things before, so I am not really sure where that came from.

Normally I handle confrontation well, but the friend is like 3 times my size. I honestly don't want to make it a bigger deal than it actually is. Any advice as to what I should do? I was thinking of talking to my roommate once the guy left.

\---  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : I feel that my roommate's BF is threatening me and I feel uncomfortable in my apartment. I don't want to make it a big deal or anything, but I am concerned that he will do something. What should I do?"
relationships,Not sure if I’m overreacting or not about what I (24f) found on BFs (25m) phone,"Gonna keep this as brief as possible. 

Basically about 2 years ago, I caught my boyfriend sexting another girl. He had told me they were just friends and I didn’t think anything of it nor did I care they talked. Then one day while he was at work he asked me if I could go on his laptop and send him something. He has messenger linked to his laptop and I saw a weird message pop up from this girl. I caved and I looked and saw they had been sexting here and there. I pretty much packed my shit with no idea WTF to do because we had JUST signed a lease and paid our dues. My boyfriend and our roommate ended up convincing me to stay and boyfriend vowed to be transparent and help rebuild the trust. 

It worked and went great, he never tried to hide anything and even though I didn’t want it he gave me access to his social media to prove he had nothing to hide. Eventually I knew we needed to move past this so I told him I think I can trust him again and let’s just move on. I don’t want to feel like I need access to your private social media. All was well. 

Yesterday morning his phone kept going off and he wasn’t waking up to stop it so I did and I saw a message preview from this old friend from highschool of his that he just recently started talking to again. At first I felt insecure because of what happened but he assured me they’re just friends. Ok. I let it go. But now this message preview I see it’s her telling him about a dream she had where he kissed her. Again I’m like FUCK and I cave and look. And she’s telling him in great detail about this dream she had where they were in a house and he kissed her and he did kinda disregard the kissing part n shit but then he asked her what the bedroom looked like. And her response was just a normal explanation of a bedroom and from there they just kept talking but honestly this all feels too familiar. I feel like it’s just a matter of time before this starts to turn into a repeat of what happened 2 years ago. I feel stupid for staying. I feel icky for looking. I don’t feel right. I haven’t said anything but I’ve been quiet. 

Basically I’ve been thinking since then that I should break up with him before this turns into round 2 but my friends are telling me I’m overreacting and that he didn’t actually entertain the kiss part. But they are talking MUCH more now and it feels like they’re testing each others waters. Idk. What should I do. Am I an idiot to think this is the extent of it, or should I listen to my gut and run now. 

Tl;dr caught bf sexting years ago, worried it’s about to happen again cause I found new messages

relationships,"Coworkers think I said something that I didn’t, now it’s making me paranoid [31m]","Coworkers took a joke comment serious and it’s making me paranoid how I seem now


At my current job I work with people I really enjoy talking to but suddenly I’ve been paranoid over coming across like a weirdo

Long story short: my manager is a bit of someone who likes to stir the pot humourlessly, I love her she is great to talk to and get along with and she is really funny.

Recently a situation came up with a couple of my coworkers, she made jokes about how me (a guy) always gets attention off of them and said they follow me about. She meant this in a playful way, it’s her humour, she was making a joke.

I said this to them, as a joke, and they took it seriously. To the point where they asked me about it at a later date. To the point where they started telling other people about something they claimed I said legitimately

I basically explained to them that:
No I don’t think they follow me, and that id tell them to go away if I did actually think that. I Also said that it was my manager who made that comment and it was a joke.

Now I’m left in a state of paranoia where I feel like I look like a weirdo, or a liar etc.

This is really dumb I know but any advice, I feel like if I brought it up anymore I’d look stupid after already explaining it.

relationships,My girlfriend (22F) for 3.5 years said she doesn't have feelings for me (21M) anymore.,"So I know this would be highly overdone and obviously this is nothing new. But this was my first relationship of my life and so this is really important. 

TL;DR: 
So this girl, (let's call her Shruti)and I have been dating for a long time but most of our relationship has been in long distance since we're in different colleges. But even through that, we were going strong. Ofcourse, being so far away from each other, we had our ups and downs. We met in different cities in between semesters because even tho we were from the same hometown, it was hard to meet properly during sem breaks because of our families. 

It had been 2 months since we had gone to a trip last but then I got a little busy with my academics so we lessened our daily conversation. 
So one day, all of a sudden she said that she wanted to break up because she was now confused about her feelings. And she needed time. She said that she wanted around 6 months to figure shit out. I asked why it was so, she said that things were getting monotonous. 

Now see, I admit that things actually were getting a bit monotonous. Because we weren't able to meet that often because of low finances and I had some busy semesters in between and also we couldn't spend our special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries together. 
But I had planned a lot of shit for her this semester since I was free. I had planned to spend new year's, her birthday and our anniversary together.. Which we had never done before. But alas I kept it as a surprise. I even told her this stuff after she said what she said. 
Upon further questioning, she said that she had been feeling attracted toward someone else and she didn't wanna be cheating on me by feeling for someone else. She said she had not lost all feelings for me but they were disappearing. 

Then two months later of no contact with her, (I gave her her space), I find out from our mutual friends, that she told them that she had lost all feelings for me. I was obviously heartbroken. 
Nothing had ever been wrong between us. We didn't have any other issues. There were obviously some fights but nothing too big. We were always there for each other. 
I never saw something like this coming. It was too sudden. 
Okay so also she always says that she feels guilty for losing feelings and I had been just perfect. But I don't get exactly why she lost them. 

It has been 5 months now and she started talking to me again, possibly because of the lockdown. We live nearby too, so we met a few times. I've been helping her with her preparation for her post grad. I asked her again, if she had developed some kind of feelings, or anything. She said no. 
I still wanna win her back because I know for a fact that she did love me. I don't know what happened. It just did. 

Any suggestions or advice?"
relationships,"Even though i am officially an 'adult' (30,F) i need to talk to an adult right now for some perspective 🙈","To start with, i (30,F) have issues which make it very difficult to actually know how i think or feel as i tend to over analyse and look at things from every possible angle and perspective and it just goes round and round till i drive myself crazy so I'm looking for some rational perspective! I have got talking to a guy (24,M)and in so many ways he fits the bill for everything i want and haven't found so far - lovely, kind, wants to settle down and live the quiet life, live the family life (i am a lone parent to my 16month old daughter), he is very understanding of my mental health problems and ticks so many boxes. However, i have alot of doubts and worries and i just need some perspective/experiences... We have very different lifestyles, hes a very heavy smoker, and a terrible sleeper, and doesn't eat/drink healthily at all. With my mental health problems and much of the last few years focussed on keeping mentally well and everything involved with that (eg exercise, healthy eating, good sleep habits) it really worries me. The thing is, he basically says that he's just been waiting for the right person to change the lifestyle for. I understand this but part of me feels like these changes should be for himself not for me/my daughter. He says that he couldn't do it for himself and he just needs that motivation of doing it for someone else. Is this red flags or is this normal?

TL;DR  is it a bad sign for someone to only want to change their bad lifestyle habits for you and not for themselves"
relationships,My (26/M) girlfriend (26/F) hates my best friends and does not like when I spend time with them. This frustration is getting very serious.,"I guess first I should mention that I have a group of male friends that I have known for over 10 years now and we occasionally like to go out drinking with one another. All these friends of mine bring their girlfriends along when we get together. Well my girlfriend has never felt comfortable around these people. She never feels like my friends try to have conversations with her and I am aware of this dynamic as well so I can totally understand her frustrations. My friends have a tendency to want to talk about “guy stuff” and don’t really get the girlfriends involved in our talks a lot of times and my friends girlfriends are friends with one another but not that close with my girlfriend. I’ve tried a lot to get her involved, but she is just clearly having a bad time when we get together.

Well she talks negatively about my friends to her friends all the time and how she hates the “vibes” she gets with them. My friends seem to understand that my girlfriend is not a big fan of theirs, and over time they just decided that maybe it’s best not to invite her along when we do things (for her sake as well because she is clearly not enjoying her time). I think it’s important in a relationship to spend time with your friends so I have been continuing to spend time with these people (granted it is virtually in these current times), and she hasn’t been getting the invites and it is making her extremely upset. The way I look at it is that these people have been my friends for most of my life and I’m not going to cut them out of my life just because my girlfriend doesn’t vibe with them..but I guess she feels that she has been cut out of my group and that makes her angry. I’m not really sure what the best solution is. She doesn’t even want to go join in on these things but she gets upset that she isn’t getting invited, and I try to explain to her that she has her friends she spends time with and I should be able to have the same thing for myself. I really feel torn and extremely sad about this to the point I am in tears. I’m trying to be as understanding as possible but she is so angry and guilt trips me anytime I spend time with these people. Am I not thinking through this rationally? Does anyone have any advice on how I might need to change my perspective to really be more understanding? Am I in the wrong here in any way? Thanks all.

Tl;dr: Girlfriend justifiably dislikes my best friends. She gets very frustrated to not feel included. I don’t know if I am handling this situation in the right way."
relationships,I (17 F) resent my sexist parents (47 F and 49 M),"I will be 18 in a month! The problem is that I've always been a sheltered child because of my sexist parents.

I have never been allowed to go to parties or hang out just because of my gender. My dad always tells my mom he doesn't want me to go around and have sex and that's why I'm not allowed to hang out. He thinks all women just want sex. 

When I turned 10, I wanted to join a boxing class but my parents said they wouldn't let me because it wasn't feminine and that my body would get ruined. When my brother (now 24 M) was 10, they fully supported him when he said he wanted to participate in a boxing club at the local multicultural center.

When I turned 14, my dad said that I would never do anything with my life because I would ""get pregnant and drop out of high school"" like my aunts. That made me cry. I was a 14 year old who knew nothing about sex and he was already ridiculing me. On the other hand, my brother was encouraged to be sexually active at the age of 14. 

When I joined the theatre extracurriculars at my high school, my dad was really discouraging of it. He told my mom, who recently told me this, that he didn't want to join the drama club because he didn't want me to ""have sex with the theatre kids."" I was committed to acting and I wasn't looking for sex. 

I asked my mom to let me hang out with friends during high school and she said ""not until you're 16."" But I turned 16 and they didn't allow me to do anything. 
They would let my brother do anything he wants just because he's a guy. They would let him hang out when he was 12. Meanwhile, I've only been to a non-school event ONCE, and that was last July. :( 

Now that I'm graduating high school and turning 18, I want my independence. I plan on getting my license within the next few weeks. I also want a job in the next few weeks. My parents don't want me to get a job because they can't accept that they are losing control of MY life. They can't accept that I want to take control of MY life as and become an ADULT. BTW I'm moving out when I'm 18 because I'm tired of being treated like a prisoner instead of their daughter. So I need a job no matter what.

I'm going to have a serious conversation with them about boundaries because they treat me like a 5 year old who doesn't know what's going on. How do I tell them to back off?

Tl;Dr: My (17 F) parents (46 F & 49 M) have never let me hang out of do things on my own just because I have a vagina. I am turn 18 in a month and I want my independence. How do I tell them to back off?"
relationships,How do I (F27) support my boyfriend (M32) after a near death experience he had today?,"Hi Reddit, my boyfriend of almost two years is a volunteer firefighter. This morning, he responded to a call where a house was engulfed in flames with an old lady inside. At the direction of his chief, he and another firefighter went inside to try to rescue her. They made it half way into the house when the floor started to give way and he made the decision to turn around. They barely made it out in time before the house exploded. 

I FaceTimed with him for around 10 min this afternoon and I can tell that he is extremely shaken by what happened (understandably). He said that he doesn’t want to talk about it again after today to which I said was totally fine and that I’m always here if he wants to talk about it. He looked like he was about to cry at one point but turned the camera away first. There’s counselling services available to him through the department but he said that he doesn’t need them. In his words, he said that what he struggles with is the “what if’s” and thinking about everything that he could have almost missed out on in life. 

I’ve never personally experienced something like this so I’m struggling with knowing how to support him best. I want him to know that I’m here for him and would love to encourage him to go speak with a professional but I don’t want to be overbearing or suffocating. He’s been through a lot in his life with family/other scenes he’s responded to but this one seems different since it was such a close call. 

Any advice about how to support him would be super appreciated.

Tldr; Boyfriend almost died in a house fire and is visibly shaken. How do I as his girlfriend best support him?"
relationships,"Good man, bad sex, old ex. Should I leave?","So. This is a very complicated situation, for me at least, for you it will be a very long story. Please help, I need advice. My husband and I are 27 and 28, we have been together for 6 years give or take a few months. 

 I have always been a highly sexual person, however, I didn't lose my virginity until I was 19. That being said, I wasn't as sheltered as my mother believed. I was well aware of sex, masturbation, porn and all the shame that goes along with it. I felt shame after every time I flicked the bean and I would generally do it any time I thought I had enough time to get away with it. I always viewed sex and relationships as this glorious thing that existed on the other side of a wall that was locked until you figured out how to date. I never had sex during high school because I thought all sex was as nasty and exposing as porn was, and I had a rough kink so I never wanted anyone I had to see on an every day to know all my nitty gritty secrets. I idealized long monogamous relationships and even though I had watched my parents fight their way through a long marriage with 5 kids in the mix I recognized that as my future. I thought that was love was for a long time, someone you didn't always have to like but couldn't imagine life without. 

When I did lose my virginity, I was 19yo and two days into the first relationship I had ever had and didn't even think the relationship would last. I thought if I told (we will call him Dustin) Dustin I was a virgin he would be afraid of me getting too attached and he would leave with my hymen still intact as others had. As it was, our relationship was what you would expect for someones first real relationship. I wanted sex every five minutes and we celebrated every ""monthiversary...Yeah, I know, cringey. He was good at keeping pace with me for the first few months but when things inevitably slowed down I thought he was bored with me or that I wasn't hot enough. I was a sex addict before ever having had sex though so it wasn't his fault, it was all on me, I was greedy, I didn't know how to be any other way. We struggled because it pushed a wedge between us, and made him want to spend less time with me. That relationship ended about 10 months later due to him texting his ex every day and me finding out by going through his phone. They sent daily ""miss yous"" and photos back and forth, and then I saw a photo of a drawing he had given to me. It was an outline of a buck surrounding a country girl he had given to me a few weeks prior, in the message to her it was a pic of an early sketch that said ""hey sweetheart, I drew you something."" Sweetheart was my pet name. After realizing it was a drawing of her and not just the generic country girl I believed it to be, I became furious. I told him I was done and waited for him to explain, defend himself, fight for me or anything. Instead he packed up his stuff silently and drove back to his hometown, leaving me with the pain of my first break up without having any closure from the fight. It took me months and a lot of alcohol to get over the fact that he didn't fight for me and that it seemed like he was perfectly fine while my whole world had caved in. 

Fast forward 4 months of almost complete celibacy, and constant drunkenness on my part, I met Ronald (fake name) in an old fashioned way: at a karaoke bar on my 21st birthday. He wasn't even close to my normal type, but I remember he had the best smile and seemed in awe of me. I had a ridiculously bad awkward phase in my youth and was still insecure about my previous breakup, and having never known what it was like to be flirted with or to have someone fall in love with me at the first sight, I let him buy me drinks. We had a few things in common as far as simple music tastes and both my friend and his were playing a strong wing-man/woman game and really wanted us to connect. I found out later that he had even gone back to his house to get more money to keep buying me drinks. I also thought that because of his weight (he was on the larger side) that he would be well endowed, and since ya girl here, is at heart a massive slut who hadn't had sex in months, I had sex with him on the first night. I had to convince him a little, as he was worried about moving too fast because he said he really liked me. I was a little drunk and very horny and ended up getting my way, as soon as he put it in however I knew something was off. He was very small. Like I had one of those moments of, oh no that's it? He was good with his hands and the sex-while not mind blowing, did the job and we both got off. We had a pretty decent connection and he was intelligent enough to hold a conversation but I know now I would have friend zoned him that night if I could go back in time. We weren't sexually compatible but he tried so hard to please me that I couldn't break it to him that it wasn't quite what I wanted. I couldn't break his heart. I loved him very much but I struggled early on even finding him attractive, so I started calling him handsome instead of babe or his name to try to change the way my brain saw him. It worked for a while and we figured out how to get past the awkward phase in our sex life, for a little while things were great. We really connected on a companionship level and ended up moving in together right around the 6 month mark. I had reservations about being with him, but we never fought, which I realize now that was more so because he had a tendency to overreact and I learned really early on how to avoid triggering him due to my issues with mental health. This sort of turned into me just not talking. That makes for another problem later. 

About a year into this new relationship, my ex reached out to me, I was gobsmacked. I never thought he would talk to me again, and I told him I had met someone and that was the end of the conversation for probably about 2 months. Then he started to reach out to me every few months for the next 3 years. I had this whole other life that played out in my messages with him, but because I didn't want anything to come of my old relationship, and wanted to avoid hurting Ronald I kept the fact that we were talking again secret. I felt so ashamed that I was even giving him the time of day, let alone deleting conversations and hiding things from Ron that I started looking for things in Ron that I hated. Everyone in my friend group and close family member hated Dustin, and that drove a lot of what I was feeling into the closet. I did my best not to get sentimental with Dustin in any of our convos but he constantly sent photos and asked for phone calls and I was weak. I have always been weak when it came to him. Life played out in this manner for a while but eventually it was too much for me and I told Dustin I was going to really commit myself to my relationship with Ronald and ended all communication with him. 

We didn't talk for a while, and I was doing better mentally. Ron had opened up to me about his sexual issues, he suffers from not only having a below average sized penis but also he had some external injuries that he had been too ashamed to tell me about. I was heartbroken again at the thought that he had been in pain after every sexual encounter and never had the guts to tell me. After doing some research I figured out that he had micro lacerations around the head of his penis, which caused scar tissue to build up because they never healed properly. PSA: If you have a cut on your dick, don't have sex for at least 6 weeks, this is what causes dicks to bend. Left untreated the way it had been for the year to year and a half that he didn't tell me about it caused the scar tissue to basically form a band around the entire penis. He soon was unable to achieve any erection at all without pain, and this caused our already depleted sex life to take a dive. Like I said, it took him almost 18 months to tell me he was even in pain. It took me another 2 years to get him to see a doctor, and when he finally did the doc told him to get healthy. That they couldn't even go about the surgery with him at his current weight, which, now and at that point was over 300lbs. Its been about 3 years since he saw that doc and not a single thing about his lifestyle has changed, except now we are married. His habits have worsened now by corona as he now has an excuse not to leave our room, though we never left it before anyway. Our sex life evolved over the years into using toys for me and kind of a round robin, he gets me off, I help him get off, its very give and take. I just don't know if I can handle the fact that my sex life depends on a vibrator (which is broken right now), and that I haven't been penetrated by my partner in just about 4 years. To some people that seems like a small hurdle to get over. In fact a lot of people (including my old therapist) look at us and think we have this super healthy happy relationship and most wonder why we don't have kids yet. Due to the nature of our issues and them primarily being his issues, I can't seek support from anyone and even when I confide in a close friend or family member I feel like I am betraying him. I can't talk to him about it anymore because it's a very sore subject for him, and emasculates him any time I bring it up. 

We both want children but having them is going to require medical intervention of some kind due the the amount of sex getting pregnant often calls for. Our sex life has turned into what feels like a repetitive cycle of duty sex with a few coke fueled nights of ""natural"" hook ups thrown in. We still aren't having enough sex to produce a child and it feels to me that sex has become a tool of manipulation he uses when I get too crazy to deal with. There are still rare moments when our connection is there, but he doesn't seem to see the difference either way. 

Back to the whole mental health/ not talking/ no fights thing. I know this isn't healthy for me to post all of this instead of bringing it up to him, but the chances of me getting through even a paragraph of this information without him tunnel visioning and seeing red over one detail is never going to happen. He picks and chooses what he wants to hear in a conversation and leaves the rest, which leaves me feeling wholly misunderstood because we always have different conversations. I have spent the last 6 years in a strange limbo of feeling loved, being silenced, and obligated to be grateful. Pot has gone a long way to aid in the complacency feeling, along with my avoidant personality traits that make me want to hide from confrontation, or any kind of trouble where I am perceived as the bad guy.  In this relationship parts of me have regressed to childhood because I am the bad guy and he reminds me subconsciously of my dad. As a child I lied pathologically because I couldn't cope with being in trouble. My fear of being in trouble or being the cause of someone else's pain is enough for me to have stayed unhappily in a relationship that I can't be honest in any more. I have done too much of the same thing I broke up with Dustin for. The worst realization and the most debilitating thing I've come to know is that Ronald loves me the way I loved Dustin and the fear of destroying someone else for my own happiness is killing me. I feel as though I fell in love with the idea of being in a relationship so hard, I wanted to be loved so badly, I didn't notice how Ron would make these compromises for the personality traits he didn't like in me instead of realizing we had such crazy differences we both saw and accepted the love we thought we deserved. I feel like we could have had a better chance at happiness on different paths. He deserves so much more than this conditional love I'm only half able to give. I wanted to be cared for so badly and to have someone to cuddle with I allowed part of my soul to be silenced, and shaved down so that we could fit together. Now I'm realizing that those parts grow back like hair, nails, or the horns on hell-boys head, you can't fight who you are forever. 

Ron and I have been married for almost 2 years now and our problems are still our problems, now I'm starting to get scared because he is a walking heart attack, he smokes, hes over weight, he drinks occasionally, and we eat out way too much. He has also never been active after work (lube shop), he never has energy after work to do anything except watch videos, smoke pot, and play video games. Any time I mention how much screen time he gets in a day, he gets defensive and angry and makes a big deal about it only being one video or one game, only problem there is its only one game if I say something, if I don't he might spend the entire evening staring at his phone. Not only that but we have actually started to have fights, and the sex has gotten so bad, like I said the vibrator is broken and we haven't found other ways that are as satisfying or as low effort for him (its still an effort with the vibrator, just not as much). We are 5 months into this whole Rona situation and I have been out of work for the last 2, which has given me an unprecedented amount of time to think (hence my dissertation). In the midst of this, and at one of my lowest points, Dustin came back. Again. Its been 7 years since we dated and we were only in each others lives for 10 months, how is it possible for his name to still give me chills. How is it that I still feel chemistry and love for him. I know how I can still be sexually attracted to him, as he is every thing I would check off on a list of boys traits/ style I consider to be ""my type"". Hes a country boy who has grown up a lot in the last 6 years, and guys this parts the worst, he had a perfect penis. It was long and smooth, straight and thick, I had no idea how lucky I was at the time, him being my first relationship I always had this idea that if this ends I'll just find something better now that I know the secrets of dating. Boy was I wrong. Dustin added me on IG (the only platform I didn't block him on) and though it made me shiver, I didn't follow him back or block him. A few days later he messaged me, this was on mothers day. At the time I had forgotten it was mothers day, and the conversation started with him asking me how we were doing in all this corona madness, and he wanted to let me know he was worried about me and that he cared for me. I found this touching but kept him at arms length, I didn't send him photos, I didn't hang on every message or give them special attention. I messaged him back when I thought to check the app, no more. Then I remembered that his mother had died and realized that he pry reached out to me for comfort because that's always been a hard day for him. I can't figure it out but talking to him this time feels so different, like hes grown up a bit and my mind is blown that he still feels like I'm the one that got away. I always thought having someone pining after you would feel good, I mostly just feel like I need to poop, all the damn time. My nerves have been bundled so tightly with the lack of sex and now the secrecy again, on top of me falling in love with my ex again over a daydream idea that maybe my life would be further along, or on a better, simpler happier path if I had recognized the red flags in my current situation that are starting to feel like boulders now. How could I have married someone else when I so clearly never stopped loving Dustin. I hate myself every day, and have the thought, iwannadie at least 20 times a day because I'm too cowardly to be honest with my husband, too greedy to tell Dustin to f\*\*k off and yet, I'm too scared to trust Dustin and so I'm here again, questioning all of my life choices. I guess after all that if your still here, kind reader, my question is am I doomed to always feel as though there is a better life some where else? Is my current relationship as fake as it seems here on paper? Where does someone go from here. We still don't have children so leaving would be relatively easy, but how do I live with myself? Especially if I manage to find happiness as I don't feel as though I deserve a soft spot to land on at this point. 

TL;DR: need help figuring out how I got trapped in a long term monogamous relationship that is starving me sexually, ex comes back into the picture and I'm questioning every choice I ever made."
relationships,Help me out,"I [M/27] keep missing my ex [F/28] of two months and I really want her back to try and do the relationship better. But the thing is I was an asshole to her because of the way she broke up with me (through snapchat) and giving me two reasons that contradicted why she was breaking up with me. I feel like it was my fault, that I was a bit narcissistic but only the trait of loving too quickly. Got any advice on how to proceed, should I try to talk to her or just give up on her? 

TL;DR: just need advice on how to proceed with this dilemma. I really truly care about her and I want to tell her but I don't know how without losing her completely."
relationships,insecure around friendships,"So basically I am REALLY insecure about my friendships. I moved around a lot as a kid, so maybe it has to do with that? I'm still in touch with a few of my friends from middle school and high school, though so I don't know if that's my biggest problem. My parents are immigrants and my mom often complains about how she doesn't have any friends her age, so maybe that's rubbing off on me? Also one of my best friends from high school ghosted me about 2 years after going to separate colleges but she ghosted another friend too so it's really just her being a bad person or wanting to move on.

Now, every time I reach out to an old friend and they take a while to text back, I panic and feel worthless until they respond. I also am really sensitive when making new friends and I think about whether we will be friends in the future like if they will be at my wedding etc. Why am I so insecure and sensitive about this??

If it helps, I have generalized anxiety disorder and mild OCD about certain things.

Also any advice on how to get over this?? Is this just a part of OCD and reassurance behaviors or something?

&#x200B;

TL;DR; insecure about friendships, how do i get over it?"
relationships,Does your significant-other think you talk over them but in reality they talk over you?,"My (25f) boyfriend (33m) says I talk when he’s talking some of the time. But from my point of view he talks a lot (he’s a very passionate guy) and I wait for pauses (or lulls in the conversation) to insert a question or whatever... by the time I start talking he has already continued on talking about either that topic or something similar to it. 

It’s very frustrating. How do you guys handle someone who thinks you’re talking over them... but in reality you can’t seem to get a word in. 

Sidenote: this doesn’t happen often in our relationship. It just happened a little bit ago where he paused and I asked a question but he was talking again... so I asked him to repeat himself. He asked me “and why don’t you remember what I said?” Obviously because we were both talking at the same time. And then he pointed out that I seem to talk over him. 

tl;dr boyfriend thinks I talk over him, but I think it’s the other way around. How have you guys handled this kind of situation or someone who talks over you?"
relationships,"She said she needs space, but still sees her future with me???","Hello everyone, I’m new here and never actually made a post. I’m a 24/m and she’s 24/f, we’ve been in together for 5 years.

About a month ago my gf and I had a argument and the next day, she told me that she needed some space. So I gave her space without bothering her for a month..

Fast-forward a month later, I text her and she said that “I’ve never left you, obv I still care about you”...

Unfortunately I broke down and pleaded to her tearfully and told her everything under the son because I realized how much I love her. I wasn’t perfect but I know for certain that I was very good to her.She was cold and distant. So I drove to her house the following day and ask her to come outside and I begged her again, and she said “obviously I still see you as the future father of our future children and my future husband.”

She told me that she had neglected herself so much and maybe we could start out fresh. Then when I left her place she texted me and said “I haven’t given up on us, and I don’t want to cause you any heartache or stress.” She also said she still has a lot of healing to do, her anxiety was killing her, and when I asked her why we couldn’t walk through it together, she said because she wouldn’t be able to give 100%.

I’m confused and would just like some advice please.


TDLR: We agreed to a break, a month later when I checked up on her she said we were broken up. Pleaded with her to 2 days, even drove to her house. She said she hasn’t given up on us, I’m still her future husband. I’m lost."
relationships,I (23F) don’t want my boyfriend (25m) to invite one of his friends to the wedding and we can’t agree on what to do,"My boyfriend and I were discussing our future engagement and wedding (again). We ran into the same issue we have before, and it ended in an argument. He wants this friend to be a groomsman, or at the very least be a guest at the wedding. We’ve argued about it and seem to be at an impasse. Tl;dr at the bottom. 

Some background, my boyfriend has known this friend since high school. His friend is the older brother of a girl I went to school with. The girl and I don’t get along due to her generally arrogant, manipulative attitude and need to be better than everyone at everything. She manipulated her parents into thinking I’m a bad person, and they don’t like me either. The brother seems to be somewhat indifferent. He went behind my boyfriend’s back on something a few years ago and lied to his face for months before finally admitting to what he did. The friend ignores my existence when we hang out, apart from greeting me. My boyfriend admits he likes playing sports with this friend and talking only about superficial stuff, not about anything too personal or meaningful because he doesn’t trust him. 

My boyfriend wants to put this guy in the wedding party, or at the very least invite him as a guest at the wedding and he seems pretty firm about that. He believes he’d seem rude and would upset the friend by not inviting him, especially since their other friend (my boyfriend’s best friend) will be there. He thinks it will cause the friend to end their friendship. My boyfriend feels caught in an awkward spot between not upsetting the friend and not upsetting me. 

I really don’t want this friend to share in our wedding, and I don’t want him or his family in too much of my personal life. I understand that’s my boyfriend’s friend, but our wedding is a special occasion and I can’t see how you’d want to invite someone you don’t even trust. It would not make my day more special by having him there. I don’t trust the friend, and I don’t like being around him. I don’t want him to share in our special day, arguably one of the most important ones in a relationship. I feel stuck between being a controlling jerk who makes my boyfriend choose between me and his friend, or making my boyfriend happy but not being able to enjoy myself. 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend wants a longtime friend he doesn’t really trust to be a groomsman or guest at our wedding because he doesn’t want to upset the friend or potentially cause the friendship to end. I really don’t want the friend at the wedding at all because I don’t trust him, I don’t like being around him, and I don’t want him or his family in my personal life. 

Is there any way to compromise? Or will I have to give in and accept that this guy will be in our wedding?"
relationships,Do I (23m) owe my two old roommates (23m) rent money for late notice?,"My lease with two friends ends on May 31st, and I told them I would not be re-signing on May 13th (2.5 weeks before).

They have since signed the lease (just them 2) and found a friend of theirs to take my spot, although he is not able to move in until July because of his current lease.

They have asked me to cover his rent for June. I don’t think this is fair and plan on negotiating

My rationale is: I don’t owe anything and it was their choice to sign a lease knowing I was not going to sign. I am already planning on moving out by May 31st so I will not need to have access to the property after that time, and so any money I give them would be a gift. Now here’s where it gets a little complicated. One of the roommates is a friend and I don’t want to leave on bad terms, and I do feel guilty that I didn’t give them a month’s heads up.


How much should I give them?

TLDR: the guy replacing me doesn’t want to pay for June rent, and I’ve been asked to cover it for him. What should I do?"
relationships,"I (23m) don’t know if I love my (23) gf (3years) anymore, or if there is something wrong with me.","Sorry if tittle looks like click bait, but I’m really freaking out.

My relationship has their ups and downs, like every relationship, I think but for some reason I’m kind of out of it.

I was think about how I’m really uncomfortable when going up with her, for some reason I really don’t enjoy it, I don’t know why I always feel out of place, but I cant think of anything actually wrong in the relationship.

I thought in my ex gfs, I realized that I got bored in second year of every relationship I ever had, but the thing is, I think I’m happy but I don’t know if I’m happy cuz I’m with her or if I would be happy without her too. 

With most of them I wasn’t uncomfortable going out, but for some I got uncomfortable too at the second year, and I slowly stopped trying and doing things.

I daydream a lot of going to clubs and dancing, (we are Christians, but she is way more old school and has way more rules), I don’t drink anymore (not religious, just never liked it that much) but I miss dancing and even if she would go I don’t feel like I would enjoy with her, I feel like I really don’t want to trying things with her.

And I don’t know if maybe I had never actually love someone or if I just have never feel in the same place with someone.

I would definitely say, our first years was like a dream,  she is an amazing woman probably the best girlfriend I had, but I don’t know what is wrong with me, she get really sad when we are apart cuz she says I don’t miss her and I haven’t told her but I don’t do, I miss cuddles with her and that’s about it.

Stay inside orders make this significantly worse, everytime I call her is cause I know she needs it, but I’m fine without it, i don’t know if I should break up, I wish I could ask for time! But what if she don’t wait for me or gets hurts, asking for time is kind of selfish too, I don’t want to waste her time either.

TL;DR: I get bored in every relationship in the second year and I don’t know if is something wrong with me or if I should let it end, so I don’t waste her time."
relationships,How can I [M/25] fix this ongoing issue of communication with my gf [F/24],"We start of strong most of the time but it tends to slip.  As for why I’m writing this, I’ll give you an example of today’s communication and In hopes reddit can help us understand each other’s feelings better.

Today my gf texted me a good morning and wanted to talk about how we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one couples therapist and search for a few different ones which may specialize more for younger couples and their communication patterns.  Which of course I agreed.  

However, the conversation soon changed to things I’ve done and she’s unsure if her investment in me (dating me again after we’ve broken up) is worth it.  We’ve both done our fair share of faults in things we’ve said and done, but I can’t help but feel like I was being the center of the reason for all the downfalls.  Constantly bringing up things that did which gives her reason to have her doubts.  I have told her several times that I have acknowledged my faults in the relationship, apologized for my faults and behavior at times and have tried to show consistency in my words with my actions of being more there, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  It’s still very early to see this consistency as a trend, but the efforts are there.  

I was starting to feel down mid conversation as it was about me and my previous actions.  It was starting to sound like there was no room from improvement on my end.  She started asking me if everything is okay as she noticed I was being quieter and less involved in the conversation.  I told her basically what I said in the paragraph above.  

She assumes I’m taking the defense by not being as involved in the conversion now.  She now mimics my behavior by being short answered and is clearly upset for me being upset with how the conversation took a turn.  I validate her that it’s okay for her to have her doubts, but I don’t think it’s fair to throw me completely under for the downfall of the past break up as it takes two to tango.  She was also saying that just because we plan on going to therapy that things won’t miraculously work out.  Of which I also agree, (not all investments make money) but that doesn’t mean I can’t remain hopeful that we will develop tools to help our communication and interpretation of each other’s words.   

Ultimately, could I have handled the negativity better? What could I have said or done to improve this communication?

TL:DR - I try to stay positive through my gf’s doubtful thoughts of us getting back together, but I can’t but feel like she doesn’t leave room for improvement.

Edit: I just want to say that our arguments back before the breakup were mostly kitchen sink fights.  Since getting back together, I've tried to avoid statements like, ""you always did this"" or ""you do this.""  Since I know these are fighting words, I want to limit the aggression that can arise between us.  I do say though, ""i dont think you should have such a pessimistic view and look at how therapy could be a life changing tool for us."" I also dont want her to look through a narrow scope that I'm the only reason; But that she has also made comments that influenced my behavior at times.  And btw, our relationship has never been physically abusive.  And we've also never pressured the other person to something like have sex.  It's always been mutual."
relationships,Should I [23F] bother reaching out to him [26M]?,"After a painful, unexpected breakup with the man I was dating in december, we were very low contact for months in late feb he resurfaced and expressed regret for having breaking up with me. He said things like the 12 weeks he spent dating me were better than his whole 2 year relationship. For context I have known him for 2.5 years, met just after he broke up with his gf, and due to many logistical problems we couldnt date. Then I moved close, 80 miles away vs 5000. He then broke up with me in december citing 80 mi was too much, though he had plenty of time to understand the distance.

When he contacted me again I got a high from it as I missed us being together. At this point he barely texts me. I am sad to admit that I have sent nudes to him and strip for him on cam, cuz I know he enjoys that.

I can see that it is a mistake and will never do it again. He had the whole weekend off and didnt message me and hasnt for a while. Should I bother reaching out? I feel resentful towards him.

**tl;dr**: Should I bother contacting him again? I hate to initiate."
relationships,My [20s f] dad [60s m] is being banned from my mom's [60s f] funeral and I don't know what to do,"Unfortunately, my mother recently passed away. This was incredibly unexpected. She lived about 1000 miles from me, and in the same city as my uncle (her brother) so he just started taking care of everything (cremation, paperwork, moving furniture out of her apartment, etc). We're delaying the release of her ashes at the beach because of the current global situation (and we're not having an indoor ceremony at all).

&#x200B;

I have been told by my grandma that my dad is banned/not invited to the funeral and banned from staying in her or my uncle's home. My parents had divorced 4 or so years ago, and were married for over 20 years. Their divorce was complicated. When he divorced her, it was in the hopes she would ""hit rock bottom"" and stop abusing prescription medication, and then get back together in a couple years (also in part caused by stress from a child protective services investigation, it's a loooooong story). Being banned from the funeral would really upset him (He doesn't even really know that side of the family dislikes him). He does not currently know, and I will have to be the one to break the news. 

&#x200B;

My grandma has told me that my mom was very clear that she didn't want my father at the funeral. My mom never told me this, but I believe my grandma. She didn't specify if that was the only reason (I was trying to be gentle and not press her). From what I can guess, though, I think my grandma has the view that my dad was emotionally (and maybe financially?) abusive to my mom and it worsened my mother's mental state significantly. It's also possible she knows some things about their relationship I don't. It is apparent that his presence would really upset them, and I don't want them to feel even worse while they mourn.  

&#x200B;

I realize that so much of this relies on years of context and the opinions of each person involved have wildly varying perspectives. From my perspective, my dad seems to be narcissistic to some degree, and would often make mean comments at my mom growing up. I think my mom had borderline personality disorder (she was diagnosed bipolar 2 but her most recent psych thought it was a misdiagnosis) and she was abusing prescription meds, most notably oxys (whether to self medicate or get high, I don't know, I would guess the former). Both parents seemed to have anger issues to some degree. My mom would regularly be losing her mind screaming for hours (whether or not anyone was responding) when I was growing up. She would also regularly lay in bed for days at a time. My dad would call her a ""lazy piece of shit"" and tell her to ""get a job"" (she worked occasionally as a substitute teacher) and he wouldn't give her money to buy things (she wanted a new winter coat and he bought me the one she wanted). My mom would threaten to kill him by putting coumadin in his food, and she tried to mildly light him on fire (though she claims the blanket wasn't flammable). I'm trying to include as much detail as possible so you can best understand their relationship, to understand where I'm coming from. Ultimately, they both displayed abusive actions towards each other, but I couldn't tell you who the ""primary aggressor"" was, and I'm done trying to figure it out. 

&#x200B;

My dad would be helpful with logistics of getting to and from the funeral/my relatives' places if we were to drive (and in helping to move her personal effects). But I'm not sure he would be great at the emotional support end of things, to be honest. (He pesters me about finances, college, job prospects, etc and it all gives me bad anxiety).

&#x200B;

I don't even feel like I really have a say in who gets to go to the funeral or not because I am not planning it, and it seems like it is just something that has been decided. I'm not sure what I should do. Should I push back a bit against my extended family and try to get my dad to be able to attend the funeral (even if he would have to get a hotel or stay w/ his brother or something)? Or should I tell my dad that unfortunately he can't come to the funeral? How much weight does the wishes of the deceased hold when planning a funeral? What is the right and moral thing to do? I wish I didn't fucking have to deal with this. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My dad is being banned by my relatives from my mom's funeral. They were divorced and had a long rocky history of marriage. Should I go along with his banning or try to convince them to change their minds?"

How Do I Try to Rekindle this Relationship Before It's Too Late?,"Disclaimer: I am using a throwaway account to help me stay anonymous from my main account. I previously posted in another subreddit and was recommended this one. I didn't get any sleep. I feel like complete shit right now. All I do is want to stay in bed and cry. I can't eat even though I'm hungry. I can't do anything without crying. I can't look at something without it reminding me of him. The only upside is that I cant work due to quarantine...so that is one less thing I have to worry about.

My boyfriend (M27) of 6 years broke up with me (F26) last night and said it was due to lack of sex. I don't understand what made him do this last night. We were watching movies, laughing, and having a good time and he just brings up this break up out of nowhere. He didnt even ask for sex today. I thought everything was smooth. 

He informed me he felt like has tried everything to solve our deadbedroom, told me I'm like a starfish in bed, and he no longer loves me. He packs his stuff and I'm begging him not to go. I told him I would do anything, change into the girl he deserves to have, be better, and asked for another chance but he just tells me no. He's now packed his stuff and is god knows where...his parents live out of state and he doesn't hangout with a lot of people.

He hasn't called or text me back despite my trying to reach out to him. Its really sad to think that someone you have spent so much of your life and built history with is now a complete stranger. The wedding and honeymoon we've talked about will never happen. The kids we dreamed of having will never exist. Missing his touch and presence and doing all the fun things we used to do will never happen again...

I don't know why I wasn't interested in sex. I used to have a high libido in my past relationships...it just became low after a year or so in this relationship. It's not that I don't find my boyfriend attractive, I've always thought he was the one of the best men I've ever been with. There wasn't any specific one thing. I just got comfortable in the relationship and my self esteem was super low. He called me beautiful everyday but I was never happy with my own looks. I realize now that me looking good for him should of been enough and I pissed it away. 

I would do anything to have him back. I would put forth all the effort to work on my libido. I would make a promise and actually work with him. He tried telling me so many times I just ignored it. I offer no excuses. I know it may come off as hysterical bonding, but I'm trying not to do that. There is something that just clicked that made me realize how important sex is in a relationship.

Please don't tell me it's too late. How do I have save this relationship? I really want things to work out and I cant imagine being with anyone else but him. I want to be the girl he deserves and make him happy. Please advice me on how I can save this relationship from a dreaded break up?

**TLDR:** My boyfriend broke up with me due to sex. I want to try try to save this relationship and show him that I can change so I can be the woman he deserves. Please advise on this?"
relationships,Should I stay or should I go?,"So I (26f) have been with my spouse for 2.5 years (25m) and just recently had a baby with him and I have an older child from a previous relationship. Here’s my issue - he follows a lot of single very pretty localish women on Instagram and I’ve creeped the ones I can see and he’s always liking there pictures - some provocative some not ... and we’ve talked multiple times about how it makes me feel insecure in our relationship that these women can be attainable to him versus Instagram models etc. He’ll stop liking the pictures but goes back to it after a bit thinking I’m not paying attention and it bothers me so we basically go in circles with the conversations every few months. It makes me feel unattractive and I feel by his actions that he doesn’t want me, he says otherwise but doesn’t seem to do much to change my feelings on this for very long ... in the beginning he was very much about me and compliments and showing me affection and such.. now it’s just not happening unless I point it out. My confidence has tanked and I caved and went through his Facebook and saw he looked up a girl multiple times that’s a cam girl - said he looked her up because she was on the dirty ... I mean curiosity is fine but he looked her up a few times and well she’s pretty provocative with what she puts out there. I’m sick of having these conversations and wondering if an ultimatum or counselling would help? Or should I just give up and deal with it or walk away. I love this man with all my heart and we’ve built a life together and I’m tired of feeling like he gets to just throw it away. The other thing driving me nuts is that he looks single on both Instagram and Facebook... he doesn’t post anything about us. He’s posted maybe two pictures in the last three years (not of us) and says he just doesn’t use them like most people do .. seriously need advice if I’m being fed bullshit or if he’s being honest because my gut just won’t let this go anymore.

tl;dr: spouse won’t truly stop following other women or make it visible he’s with someone - should I stay and fight or just give up?"
relationships,"I (28f) am bothered by my fiance's female friends, not sure if it is just me","Thus has been bothering me , but there hasn't been a specific incident recently but just something I am not sure if I am being too jealous about . 

My fiance has an easy time making female friends at work , particularly because we both work in a very male dominated industry where young females entering are propositioned by almost everyone they meet. He is not like those men and does not try to take advantage . The reason I know this is because I was in the same situation entering the workforce and went through it myself , but when I worked with him I could open up and we had a lot in common and ended up dating . We have been together for 5 years now . 


I left that company and went to others but he has been making friends with most of the female trainees for the same reasons we became close at first, they have no one they can trust there. He did go out to lunch with them occasionally to resturants usually one at a time, and at one point went to a conference together shared a rental car and had plans to meet with their boss at a bar but he never showed and they drank and eventually left .  There was another group where two of the girls were friends,  and just recently he bought the ""time travelers wife "" on amazon and sent it to one and I got mad when I found out because it is a romance book , but when I confronted him he said I was being extreme and it was just something the other girl helped him pick out for a birthday present (also he doesnt read much so I believe he didnt really know what it is about or care ). 

One of the girls he talks to almost every other day , but nothing flirty. But it still bothers me but I am not sure that it should . Silly things like the girl called once because she was in a new state and picking out furniture and it made her cry because she was lonely and he talked her through it, whereas in our relationship he is not emotionally comforting and does call me dramatic if I cry . Like to the point I cut myself pretty bad with a knife when he was away and the way he consoled me was ""dont cry so loud you dont want to freak out our stepson"" who was 17 lol. 

There was another girl who worked on his line and was the only female on his line, and she talked to him a lot. She ended up becoming pregnant with another employees baby but was a lesbian  , so she was going through some issues . He supported her by conversation and helped her as much as he could at work. At one point he was drinking , and she lived near us and I guess she called him crying about something and he actually drove over there while I was asleep in the middle of the night and she sat in his car and he calmed her down. Granted I know about all of this because he has told me. 

So I keep getting jealous of these girls, and I think it's more because he doesnt emotionally support me like he does them, he tells me he has higher standards for me. I get mad when he talks to them internally and he knows I dont like it , but I know he isnt cheating . And I feel like these girls just use him, this may be prejudice on my part because I never had male friends (and I hardly have any female friends either, combination of being introverted and moving a ton my whole life ) but i feel like these girls just use him as an emotional crutch fo get over a hard period and stop talking to him. At this point he only really talkes to 2 of the girls , and only one of them is often communication .   
What do you guys think ? I generally think I am just being overly jealous because of my own issues (not feeling supported emotionally although nothing bad is happening in my life to need support and I've gotten over my career humps already that those girls are going through now, being introverted so not understanding the amount of female friends and communication . ) also to his credit , he has male friends that he is in contact with every day, not just the female ones.

One time I did look at his phone about a year ago and saw the messages to one girl and was mad but they weren't sexual , just tons of gifs and shit when we dont talk to each other like that and I got mad. He said I was overreacting but he would stop with all the gifs and from them on hasn't let me see his phone because he says I will dig for the smallest thing and overreact (which I did do ) . A couple months ago him buying the book for another friend happened and he didnt tell me , I just happened to get a notification from amazon and saw it and got mad at him, but he said he didnt tell me because it was innocent just a birthday gift for a friend and he didnt know it was a romance book and it didnt really matter. These all seem valid to me .

TLDR: fiance's closeness and communication with female friends bothers me , but I am unsure if it is my personal hangups due to being generally different (introverted, very few friends) and I should chill out . 


Thanks!"
relationships,Potentially NSFW: My fiancé told me he's into guys and I don't know what to do,"My (27F) fiance (33M) and I have been together 5.5 years and have wedding plans locked in for later this year (coronavirus allowing that is). In the first 6 months of our relationship he disclosed that he enjoyed watching gay porn - this was a massive step for him and he claims he had never shared that with anyone. Fast forward another year or so and (TMI) but we started experimenting with anal play which he obviously enjoys and that is now a somewhat regular thing we do. We got very drunk on NYE just gone (so 5 years into relationship) and he opened up to me that he believes he is bi and has felt this way since he was a teenager but ignored it as he was ashamed. He reassured me that he loves me a lot and only sees a future with me. I asked if he wanted to explore his sexuality and meet up with guys, he stated it's something he has thought about but he wants ME involved? I offered a threesome with him and another guy but he wasn't keen on seeing me getting with someone else (which seems a little hypocritical). 

I've been thinking about it ever since and I honestly don't know what to do about this. I like to think I'm quite open minded when it comes to sexuality and I fully appreciate this is fluid - I think it's important for him to explore that side of his sexuality that he has repressed for so long. But what I don't know is how to go about this? I don't imagine it would be very comfortable for me to just sit there and watch him get with guys? I've thought about offering an open relationship but I don't think I'm really 100% okay with that and I feel like this could eat away at our otherwise really happy relationship. My other concern is that what if he's actually just gay but isn't quite ready to admit this to himself?

Besides this we are really happy, we don't fight, we have sex often, love spending time with each other, talk about kids in our near future, etc. Is there another way to support him through this? Am I missing the mark? Should I just leave? I feel like I can't talk to friends about this as I don't want to 'out' him, any genuine advice is appreciated! 

TL;DR: Fiance has opened up about being bi and I don't know how to support him through that but maintain our otherwise happy relationship."
askscience,AskScience Meta Thread: COVID-19 and reaching people in a time of uncertainty,"Hello everyone! We thought it was time for a meta post to connect with our community. We have two topics we'd like to cover today. Please grab a mug of tea and pull up a comfy chair so we can have a chat.

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&sort=top&restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

askscience,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Brian Greene, theoretical physicist, mathematician, and string theorist, and co-founder of the World Science Festival. AMA!","I'm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the Director of the university's Center of Theoretical Physics. I am also the co-founder of the [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/), an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

I'll be here at 11 a.m. ET (15 UT), AMA!

askscience,"If the coronavirus is respiratory and you can't get it from eating infected food, why can you get it through your eyes?","I have read articles stating that there is no evidence of anyone getting COVID-19 via food. The reasoning I have seen medical experts give is that COVID-19 and its virus are respiratory, so you get it from breathing it in, and if you eat it, your digestive system is separate so you won't get infected. But why then would getting the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes infect you? With your nose and mouth, my assumption was that you could end up breathing it in somehow. But I don't understand why it getting in your eyes would give it to you. I haven't seen this specifically explained anywhere. Thank you!"
askscience,Is there any amount of turbulence which could bring a plane down?,"I've heard plenty of times that this is not actually possible, but I'm wondering if it could theoretically happen.

And no, I'm not asking this because I have a fear of flying. I don't need to be reassured about anything."
askscience,"If a mother bird couldn't find enough food, would she let all her babies starve, or favor one/some and only feed them?","Sort of a morbid question, I know. A friend had a nest of robins in their yard, and just found all the babies dead under the nest, and hypothesized that a lack of food could be the cause of death. I didn't think that was likely, but didn't want to bring it up or force the issue when my friend is quite sad about the dead baby birds. I figure that if the mama bird knew that she wasn't finding enough food, she would choose one of her babies to favor and feed with what she could find, to give the best chance of her genes surviving in the next generation. Is this true? Or would she feed them equally and let them all die? If it informs the answer, the mother is still alive. Thanks in advance!"
askscience,Why is there so little neon in Earth's atmosphere?,"Neon is the 5th most common element in the universe, more so than argon. The molar mass is also 20, higher than water’s 18, so it probably doesn’t escape into space like helium does. Despite being so common, argon outnumbers neon 500:1 in the atmosphere. Why? Is it because Earth simply didn’t start with any and that the argon came from radioactive decay? Is that why there is so much Ar-40 in the atmosphere because we never had Ar-36 to begin with?"
askscience,Do our bodies make antibodies with multiple paratope configurations for the same pathogen?,"The SARS-COV-2 virus has many different unique epitopes. When a person gets infected, does their body actually make antibodies with multiple different paratopes? 

In other words, does a body's antibody response actually consist of various antibodies with various differing paratopes binding to various different unique epitopes on a single pathogen? 

A single SARS-CoV-2 virus could be surrounded by antibodies, but they're actually binding at different epitope areas based on their various different paratope configurations, with some having a higher binding affinity than others?"
askscience,Could previous exposure to other human coronaviruses prevent COVID-19 infection?,"I was reading this article [T cells found in COVID-19 patients ‘bode well’ for long-term immunity](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/t-cells-found-covid-19-patients-bode-well-long-term-immunity) which says

>The teams also asked whether people who haven’t been infected with SARS-CoV-2 also produce cells that combat it. Thiel and colleagues analyzed blood from 68 uninfected people and found that 34% hosted helper T cells that recognized SARS-CoV-2. The La Jolla team detected this crossreactivity in about half of stored blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, well before the current pandemic began. The researchers think these cells were likely triggered by past infection with one of the four human coronaviruses that cause colds; proteins in these viruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Regarding previous exposure to human coronaviruses, [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63) looks awfully similar to COVID-19 because they both attack via the ACE2 receptor. What kind of research would be needed to establish a link between NL63 exposure and COVID-19 immunity? If there is a link between NL63 (or another human coronaviruses) exposure and COVID-19 immunity, would intentionally exposing people to NL63 act like a natural vaccine to COVID-19?"
askscience,"Starting today, and continuing every day for an infinite number of days, I will add one kilogram of iron to a large heap of iron. Will my heap eventually collapse into a black hole? Or is the shock of the supernova also needed?","(Rephrased and reposted because a previous version, starting with ""If I heaped"", was taken down by the mods as hypothetical.)"
askscience,Why doesn't the CDC provided Oligonucleotide Sequences provided for Covid-19 testing match any sub-sequences provided in the updated published Covid-19 genome (version 2)?,"I have been investigating the Covid-19 testing process and more specifically how the tests were created.

From my understanding, the CDC has published Oligonucleotide Sequences ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)) that should be used by US RT-PCR test creators to detect the presence of Covid-19. From my understanding, these published sequences are the signatures for detection of the virus.

In trying to understand how these sequences were created, I took the original published sequenced genome ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2)) published in the ""Chinese Medical Journal"" and tried to find the provided CDC sequence as it is my assumption that the CDC published sequences should match the original covid-19 sequenced genome. I was able to successfully find the first provided forward primer ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT""  matching the end of line number 28261.

However, the scientists have updated the genome with a new version on Jan 17, 2020 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)) and I am unable to find the sequence ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT"" in this Covid-19 genome. I have also checked the reverse (CTG GGG TTT ...) without luck.

I would assume the entire point of picking good Oligonucleotide Sequences is they should stay static over all possible Covid-19 changes. The CDC clearly says it may change these sequences but they haven't. How is this possible to have a different published Covid-19 genome that the CDC's test doesn't detect? Isn't the fact the genome was updated problematic? Could the CDC test ""verified"" test not actually be effective as a result? Did the CDC do it's own large scale sequencing effort since the first sequence was collected from only 5 individuals."
askscience,Is there enough genetic material left in a loaf of bread to trace it back to the wheat plants used to make it?,
askscience,How fast does the humoral immune response occur (after becoming immune)?,"Hi! 

I was wondering about the speed of the humoral immune response... Once immunity towards a certain antigen is achieved following a first time infection, how fast is the body's response to reinfection? Does the body develop and maintain the memory cells for an extended period of time, with these continuously pumping out antibodies with the specific surface receptors just in case reinfection occurs, or is there an ""oh shit"" moment wherein the body has to look through its ""immunity catalogue"" to then produce the required antibodies? And finally, whichever the process is, when the known antigen re-enters the body, how fast does it take for the body to trigger and execute the immune response so as to eradicate antigen from the body?

Thanks!"
askscience,How do Genes know when to Turn On and Off?,"Certain genes are known to turn on and off at certain ages, for example in lactose intolerant adult humans (and most other mammals) the genes for producing lactase turn off after childhood.

askscience,Racial diversity in drug/vaccine development?,"Just curious if there are diversity requirements (global, national, etc??) for when developing drugs or vaccines? 

If not, what is the rationale for why it is expected to work the same for all people? Are we making assumptions about how diseases work or how the body works?  

(Hope I worded that alright, I know very little about this topic. Thank you so much for your time to everyone who reads this!)"
askscience,Can messenger RNA ever enter the nucleus?,I understand that mRNAs that are transcribed in the nucleus can sometimes stay within the nucleus or be transported out via NPCs. My question is: can cytoplasmic mRNA ever enter the nucleus? Either endogenous mRNAs or perhaps exogenous mRNAs from vaccines? Thanks.
askscience,"What does the ""hand"" part of the motor homunculus map refer to?","I'm sorry if I'm scientifically illiterate. I'm sure you can understand what I'm trying to say here. I'm just curious about this, it's not an urgent question. I'm looking at [this](https://natureofscienceib.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-07-at-7-40-38-pm.png?w=636) example and it shows quite a big area dedicated to ""hand"", but I'm unsure what it's referring to, as there are areas for the fingers and the wrist. Any answers are appreciated, and please excuse me for not sounding too informed"
askscience,"How are Windows passwords checked against particular substrings like date of birth, name etc... for security reasons when the password you type is supposed to be encrypted ?","Hello everybody, 

I don't know if my question is clear but I was wondering as a new coworker was getting her computer set up : some passwords are not allowed for your windows account (passwords that contain date of birth, name...).

&#x200B;

But how is that possible without ""storing"" somewhere, even in a cache/temp folder, the password itself and not the encrypted version like it is supposed to be done for passwords ? 

Is there a relation between the encryption of a string, and the encryption of a substring so that it can be recognized from the encrypted version of a password that security conditions are not met ?

&#x200B;

Thank you for your replies and your time

Cheers"
askscience,How many mouse clicks would it take to put the space shuttle into orbit?,It takes energy to click a mouse button. How many clicks per second would it take to launch the space shuttle entirely into its usual orbit height?
askscience,Difference between sustained wind and wind gusts?,"I’m into wind sports and accuracy of terminology. 

Quite often in nasty wind conditions, the difference between sustained wind and wind gusts will be large. Sometimes the forecast changes and the difference between the sustained wind and wind gusts will decrease, creating more favorable conditions. 
 
I’m prone to calling this favorable change a “tightened gradient” but I’m not sure this is the correct terminology. Is there a better way to describe this phenomenon? 

Thanks!"
askscience,"After two months of lockdown, how can 1000 people a day still be getting infected in Los Angeles County?",
askscience,How does your health during adolescence affect your health for the rest of your life?,"I’ve heard people talk about all kinds of things like your metabolism, cognitive ability, mood regulation etc being largely defined during adolescence or youth, and I am wondering if there’s truth to this?"
askscience,How are those incredibly zoomed out photos of the universe with the 'You are here' tag taken?,"I've seen some videos where they repeatedly zoom out starting from Earth. It eventually gets to the observable universe and a tag points to somewhere in the photo saying ""You are here"".

How are we taking a photo of ourselves? Similiarly, how is a picture of the milky way taken if we are in it?"
askscience,Is donated blood tested on cancer cells?,"I have read that cancer cells can travel through the bloodstream.

If so, is donated blood tested on cancer cells?"
askscience,Can Viruses/Germs Move From One Physical Location to Another?,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but saw some tongs used for hotdogs at a gas station. Got me wondering, if someone used the tongs, and they had a virus, could the virus ""crawl"" to the tip of the tongs, essentially getting on the food the tongs are being used for?"
askscience,"Why would a hotspot create a large igneous province in the middle of its lifespan, rather than the beginning?","My understanding (I should note that I'm not a geologist) is that large igneous provinces occur as a result of mantle plumes, and then a hotspot is left afterwards; if the plate moves, a chain of hotspot-associated volcanism is left from the igneous province to its current location.

But the Colombia River Basin Group in Washington and Oregon is in the middle of a hotspot chain, with its earliest activity having been dated about 40 million years before any flood basalt volcanism in this region.  Is there any explanation for flood basalts forming this late in the life of a hotspot?"
askscience,Is there any study being done right now for us to know when an earthquake will happen?,"I know earthquakes can never be predicted like we can predict the happenings of a typhoon, but I might be sitting on an outdated information. It doesnt have to be exact, at least an estimated time works really well, and of course the general area"
askscience,How true is “Everyone has a different fingerprint”?,
askscience,Why does our metabolism slow down as we age?,
askscience,Will I test positive after being fully recovered from COVID?,"This is not my field so I am not sure what means fully recovered exactly. The problem is that I believe I had COVID and didn't feel any symptoms because two friends of mine who live with me had fever and sore throat and we immediately isolated. We can't be sure it was covid so after a whole month we want to make a test, but would it test positive even after recovered?"
askscience,"What causes a sunburn, and what does it do to your skin cells?",
askscience,How do freezers work? Is it an endothermic reaction?,"So maybe I've got my info wrong, but I was taught in science class that cold doesn't actually give out cold particles, it's an endothermic reaction that takes heat particles in and thus feels cold. Which is really cool. 

So I told my mom, and we're both kind of confused about how freezers work. And cold days? Thanks."
askscience,How does the air in cities/high-traffic areas affect the fruits of trees? Are fruits grown in such places safe to eat?,
askscience,"Do animals that mate for life ever cheat on their ""spouse""?",
askscience,What is the average for short-term memory sentence recall?,"I tend to underline the key points of the books I read, and immediately write them down in a notebook from memory. I struggle with sentences longer than 20 words. I always reread after writing to detect any possible mistake that I may have made, then I add corrections in red when needed. After I while, I can see that I have no corrections in sentences up to 21 words. But every single sentence with at least 30 words has something in red: a comma, an inverted order of terms, the use of a synonym instead of the original word...

How dumb am I compared to the average foe?

Thanks!"
askscience,"Musical Instruments and Typing, Similarities in the brain?","I was recently thinking about how our brains process typing on a keyboard vs Musical Instruments.

Are there similarities in how our brains process the activities besides the motor function part of the brain?

When typing out a novel or playing a melody on the flute, both of them are art in a way, so I am curious if anyone has any thoughts or research articles on this."
askscience,How do animals know what to do with their eggs? How do they know something is going to hatch from it?,Do animals just intrinsically know that their eggs are going to hatch the first time they lay fertilized eggs?
askscience,Covid-19 immunity?? Can we train our bodies through limited exposure?,What happens when one receives a low dosage (below threshold required for infection) of the virus? Could this train your body to be somewhat immune or does it cause a mild/asymptomatic illness?
askscience,What are the deciding factors in the altitude that a plane flies?,"In these days of ever increasing economical efficiency, what are the main factors taken into consideration when determining the most fuel efficient altitude to fly?

Why is it 30,000 feet instead of 20,000... 10,000... or 5,000? Surely it takes a relatively large amount of fuel to get the plane 1,000 feet higher in the air. So why do they fly so high up?"
askscience,Does gravity cause a concentration gradient im solutions?,For example: Is there more alcohol in the the top of my vodka bottle if i let it sit long enough?
askscience,How do you account for a large numerical disparity between two groups when doing opinion polling?,"To preface: While this stems from the ongoing unpleasantness, this is not a political thread and I'm not seeking political feedback.

There was a [poll done recently](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/face-masks-poll-partisan-culture-war_n_5ec584fcc5b642a7d150e103) about public opinion re: wearing masks but someone pointed out that this paints a false picture in that  it makes it seem like there are two more or less equal groups on either side of the issue when that hasn't borne out with other research done specifically on that idea.

How does statistical analysis, and more specifically this sort of polling, take into account a large disparity in the actual number of pro/con respondents?

In terms of answer complexity, please assume that I'm functionally five years old when it comes to math. I'm mod of /r/dyscalculia for a reason."

askscience,If a planet spins faster does the altitude of its geostationary orbit drop?,And as a follow up question: would this make it easier or more difficult to build a space elevator assuming that the planets mass remains the same?
askscience,Why does salt water have a higher heat capacity than distilled water?,"I always add a little bit of of salt to my boiling water in a pan to get the heat capacity up, but I was curious why aqueous ions can hold more energy than just a bunch of H2Os in equilibrium can."

askscience,"The Doppler effect. Does it change a sound's pitch, or does it change the sound's speed?","If say a siren is passing by, and is changing in pitch (a two tone siren, or a oscillating siren sound) would the oscillation, or the frequency the two tones change at change also, or would it just be the perceived pitch?"
askscience,How hot is the interstellar and intragalactic space in dense galaxy clusters?,It seems to me that the space within these galaxy clusters would be that much higher because of the energies involved. Could life as we know it exist there?
askscience,How exactly do scientists fire certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation?,"For example, when we go to an X-ray, the instruments fires xray way length radiation into your body.

If you go to a mri, the machine fires of radio waves.

But how exactly do these machines do this? In our everyday lives, if we turn on the flashlight, we are mostly getting electromagnetic radiation of the visible light wavelength.

But how do scientists or machines shift that electromagnetic radiation to be mostly X-ray, or mostly radiowaves?"

askscience,Why is it relatively easier to recall the sense of taste and smell compared to other senses?,
askscience,Don't antibody tests need to detect multiple configurations of antibodies?,"I'm under the impression that multiple antibodies with different binding site structures can be made by different people for the same pathogen. Every piece of literature I read refer to ""the antibody"" for a certain pathogen like it's some kind of singular monolithic thing, where in reality I think antibodies for a certain pathogen are actually pluralistic things with a certain degree of variability? There is no ""antibody."" There is no ""the antibody"" for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 for instance can have multiple unique areas on their protein structures in which multiple different antibodies can be generated, so one recovered patient can have slightly different antibodies compared to another recovered patient, but both of their antibodies will still bind to different unique areas of SARS-CoV-2.

There are even companies that have whittled down numerous different antibody candidates to a few that have especially high neutralizing abilities against SARS-COV-2, the point being that multiple different antibodies can bind to one pathogen.

So when people talk about an ""antibody test,"" what are they talking about, exactly? 

Does the test actually detect the presence of *multiple* different antibodies, all of which have demonstrated binding effects with the virus? 

Or do the tests only detect one specific configuration of antibody, and can miss other antibody configurations, resulting in a false negative (the patient actually had been infected and did produce antibodies, just not the ones that the test is specific for)."
askscience,Is it possible to have an object whose surface area grows faster than its volume?,"I am familiar with the square-cube law, but all the examples I can find only discuss regular solids, I am wondering if it applies to all 3D objects."
askscience,What anatomical features would be especially prevalent in something that was built for head-butting stuff?,"So I am working on a personal project of designing some cool fighting robots (non functional, just art) and I want to design one that is based around head-butting it’s enemies. What kind of features would something like this have? What would it look like? 

I’ve taken a look at rams, bulls, bisons and even the pachycephalosaurs but I feel like their design could be taken up a notch."
askscience,"My dad wants to know: If Corona virus came from animals, why is vaccinating all humans the solution, and not vaccinating all animals?","It’s incredibly stupid, I know. Can someone smarter than me just destroy this argument."
askscience,Do our ACE-2 receptors go through metamorphosis at any point throughout out lives?,"So it's known that sars-cov-2 attaches to the ace-2 receptors within our lungs, and it's also known it doesn't seem to effect children as strongly. Is this possibly due to children having lungs that are still developing meaning the virus can't as readily identify the host cell? Or is it more likely that the smaller lung surface area means that children would on average be getting a smaller viral load due to less available binding sites?  I understand no one really has any solid answers at the moment but any ideas would be appreciated"
askscience,"If there is a pool suspended in the air by cables or bars or something, and someone jumps into the pool, would the cables and or bars be under any more stress?","Basically, do you really become ""weightless"" while in water?"
askscience,How does a horse know it's a horse?,"This question occurred to me when introducing a new horse to one we've had for ages. As soon as they saw each other there was definite + immediate interest, and a lot of snorting, murmuring etc, which I took to be recognition that they were the same species. Horses don't react that way to cows for example. And I don't think it was smell - there was quite a strong cross wind that day.

So it seems that they recognised each other as horses by sight. Do they know that the animal they're looking at is the same as them? If so, how do they know that?

Thanks"
askscience,Can human sweat transmit viral infections?,"My wife and I enjoy watching cooking shows and are sometimes grossed out by cooks dripping sweat in/on their stations. 
  Is our grossed out reaction unfounded?  Are we just overlooking that cooked food is cooked?
  Are viruses transmitted via sweat?"
askscience,Are any of the human body's natural responses to bacterial infections also effective against viruses?,I'm talking mainly about antibodies on a serum level.
askscience,"How did science become divided into chemistry, biology and physics?","I'm not sure if this is a question more suited for [r/AskHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/), but I'll just try anyway haha. How did science become categorised into chemistry, biology and physics? Was it something that just came about organically, or did some scientific organisation in the past agree on this? Why this particular classification system?"
askscience,Would it be possible for a blood test to identify an asymptomatic COVID carrier?,
askscience,Does traveling above any given body’s escape velocity mean that you cannot enter into an orbit with that body?,"I hope my question makes sense. If say you wanted to orbit the Alpha Centauri system or one of the specific stars therein, but you arrive at a fraction of the speed of light, say .01c. This would be far higher than any relevant escape velocity for the system. Where I get hazy is wether or not that means you could fall into a stable orbit at that speed. My interpretation of escape velocity means that any trajectory must be parabolic and until your velocity is below the escape value you cannot orbit that body no matter how eccentric or far flung your intended orbit is. Am I wrong? Am I misunderstanding the concept of escape velocity?"
askscience,Was there water on Mars when there were dinosaurs on earth?,
askscience,How did the first transistor work?,"Specifically, most articles say they used a solid slab of n-type germanium as the semiconductor component. Some articles say that there was a thin layer of p-type germanium at the top, some articles say that the electrodes generated small areas of p-type germanium around them when current was passed. Which is it? It seems like an important difference."
askscience,Do neurons or other cells generate biologically functional magnetic fields?,"Just learning about electromagnetism, and I’m curious whether anything is known about magnetic fields generated during action potentials. 
Do charged molecules interact/move with magnetic fields for functional purposes in our body?

Further, do any human cells use magnetic interactions to communicate? Do any other animals use magnetism to communicate? Is there a magnetic-gated channel perhaps, similar to a voltage-gated channel?

Thanks!"
askscience,Death toll from 'herd immunity'?,"Hi, a lot of my friends are arguing 'herd immunity' as a sort of strategy for combating covid-19.  I generally respond that this will involve many times the number of deaths that have occurred already.  My rationale is quite simple: Covid-19 has a current 1.4% mortality rate (due mostly to old people and people with poor immune function), and 'herd immunity' involves at least 60% population immunity (likely higher to be more effective). That means that if we just let the disease continue to spread as it has, the final USA death count will be 330million x 60% x 1.4% = 2.8 million.  Even if we somehow could control who gets the virus to restrict it to the healthiest people, this would mean something like a 0.4% total mortality (lowest group-mortality by age seems to be around 0.2-0.3%, and let's assume it spreads a bit outside of that).  In this case, 330million x 60% x 0.4% = 800,000 dead.  Are these assumptions valid, or am I missing something major in my estimation?"
askscience,Do we produce more urine per time when our bladder’s empty vs when our bladder’s near full?,I’m drunk
askscience,"Regarding the swap of roles of space and time beyond the event horizon of a black hole, what happens with acceleration and velocity?",
askscience,How are older people able to long term immunity to novel pathogens if the thymus atrophies at a young age?,"The thymus produces T-cells for your body but atrophies when you are young. If this is the case how do older people have any immature T-cells left specialize against a previously unrecognized pathogen, or more specially a new antigen."
askscience,Why dont we feel gravity the way we feel other forces?,"We feel the force of the ground pushing up against our feet and a skydiver feels the air pushing on their body, but an astronaut in orbit doesnt feel anything even though gravity is acting on them. Why dont we feel a downward force pushing us towards the earth?


I am flaring this as physics but not sure if biology or human body flair is more appropriate/"
askscience,What is the starchy part of a potato actually used for and is it alive?,"The key question I have is, specifically, whether the starchy interior (the vaguely white/manilla colored bit) is full of living cells performing a function or if it's just a collection of sustenance used by the actually living parts of the plant. In either case, how does a potato actually make use of the starchy substance?"
askscience,Is it possible to create an antibody that can also be spread via human to human contact?,
askscience,"What do psychiatrists aim for, when treating a patient?","As in, is there an equivalent of homeostasis for the mind?"
askscience,Can COVID-19 spread through people breathing?,Let’s say someone has COVID-19. Can them simply breathing spread the virus to others?
askscience,Why are green beans associated with botulism and not other fruits and vegetables?,
askscience,"If we have a vaccin for Corona, can we continue to make a vaccin for the common cold versions of the Corona familie?",
askscience,What is the electrical current actually doing in am antenna?,"From what I've read so far, an antenna is just a conductive piece of metal and radio waves induce an electric current in it which can be decoded into sound or images. But a piece of metal can't discriminate and is being bombarded by every radio and TV station and wifi signal and garage remote in the area right? So are the electrons just flying around chaotically? How can you make an actual electric current when the electrons are being pulled in every direction at once?"
askscience,"What exactly would earthquakes of magnitudes 10, 10.5 or 11 do to the planet?","Are earthquakes of these magnitudes possible? If not, why and are we able to tell what magnitude the strongest possible quake on earth could have?"
askscience,"Why aren't neutrinos ""supposed"" to travel away from us?","I read somewhere that neutrinos were observed leaving Earth instead of towards it, which could mean a parallel universe.

I mean, if neutrinos come to us from all directions and barely interacts with anything, shouldn't we see equal amounts of neutrinos looking as if it is coming towards and away from us?"

Amd,"The ""Zen 3"" Architecture is Coming to AMD X470 and B450","As we head into our upcoming “Zen 3” architecture, there are considerable technical challenges that face a CPU socket as long-lived as AMD Socket AM4. For example, [we recently announced](https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2020/05/07/the-exciting-future-of-amd-socket-am4) that we would not support “Zen 3” on AMD 400 Series motherboards due to serious constraints in SPI ROM capacities in most of the AMD 400 Series motherboards. This is not the first time a technical hurdle has come up with Socket AM4 given the longevity of this socket, but it *is* the first time our enthusiasts have faced such a hurdle.

Over the past week, we closely reviewed your feedback on that news: we watched every video, read every comment and saw every Tweet. We hear that many of you hoped for a longer upgrade path. We hear your hope that AMD B450 and X470 chipsets would carry you into the “Zen 3” era. 

Our experience has been that large-scale BIOS upgrades can be difficult and confusing especially as processors come on and off the support lists.  As the community of Socket AM4 customers has grown over the past three years, our intention was to take a path forward that provides the safest upgrade experience for the largest number of users. However, we hear you loud and clear when you tell us you would like to see B450 or X470 boards extended to the next generation “Zen 3” products.

As the team weighed your feedback against the technical challenges we face, we decided to change course. As a result, we will enable an upgrade path for B450 and X470 customers that adds support for next-gen AMD Ryzen™ Processors with the “Zen 3” architecture. This decision is very fresh, but here is a first look at how the upgrade path is expected to work for customers of these motherboards. 

1) We will develop and enable our motherboard partners with the code to support “Zen 3”-based processors in select beta BIOSes for AMD B450 and X470 motherboards.

2) These optional BIOS updates will disable support for many existing AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processor models to make the necessary ROM space available. 

3) The select beta BIOSes will enable a one-way upgrade path for AMD Ryzen Processors with “Zen 3,” coming later this year. Flashing back to an older BIOS version will not be supported.

4) To reduce the potential for confusion, our intent is to offer BIOS download only to verified customers of 400 Series motherboards who have purchased a new desktop processor with “Zen 3” inside. This will help us ensure that customers have a bootable processor on-hand after the BIOS flash, minimizing the risk a user could get caught in a no-boot situation.

5) Timing and availability of the BIOS updates will vary and may not immediately coincide with the availability of the first “Zen 3”-based processors. 

6) This is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to add new CPU support. CPU releases beyond “Zen 3” will require a newer motherboard.

7) AMD continues to recommend that customers choose an AMD 500 Series motherboard for the best performance and features with our new CPUs. 

There are still many details to iron out, but we’ve already started the necessary planning. As we get closer to the launch of this upgrade path, you should expect another blog just like this to provide the remaining details and a walkthrough of the specific process. 

At CES 2017, AMD made a commitment: we would [support AMD Socket AM4 until 2020](https://www.overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/amd_reaffirms_commitment_to_am4_socket_until_2020/1). We’ve spent the next three years working very hard to fulfill that promise across four architectures, plus pioneering use of new technologies like chiplets and PCIe® Gen 4. Thanks to your feedback, we are now set to bring “Zen 3” to the AMD 400 Series chipsets. We’re grateful for your passion and support of AMD’s products and technologies. 

We’ll talk again soon."

Amd,"What's the purpose of the high ""idle"" voltages on Zen 2?","So I know that there has been a lot of talk in the past about how seeing voltage spikes up to 1.5 V in low load situations is perfectly normal on these CPUs, but one thing I couldn't find an answer to despite a fair amount of searching is...why does the CPU do that in the first place? What's the purpose of pumping such high voltage into it? It only seems to generate heat, but otherwise doesn't seem to serve much purpose. Surely I'm missing something?

I mean my 3600 can run AVX Short FFTs Prime 95 stable at around 1.25V at 4250 all core OC (which is still lower voltage than what FIT pumps into the CPU on full auto mode in this test at lower frequency). The temperature at ""idle"" (not a real idle, but browser and such running) is upper 40's with spikes to lower 50's. While gaming, I can be as low as 43-45C with that. Compared to that, if I leave everything on full auto with +50 Auto OC, the CPU gets to the same 4250 frequency, but with voltage spikes of up to 1.45 V and ""idle"" temps of high 50's, spiking to low 60's and sometimes even to low 70's for a few seconds. In gaming, I get identical performance and frequency again, but some 10C higher temps and voltage around 1.35V. The voltage does drop below 1 V on ""unused"" cores at times, but it does very little for the temperature.

So what's the point? I'm sure there must be a reason why it is designed this way? I would understand if the auto stuff put the temperature somewhat higher than what is needed, just to have a bit of ""stability headroom"" for the CPU...but why go 0.2 V higher for seemingly no reason except a temperature increase? What am I missing?

Thanks."

Apparently Asus immediately changed their mind. They say B450 will get support but they don't know when.

&#x200B;

I'd like to create a list of Mainboards that will support Zen 3 to help people buying the right products for Zen 3.

I will update the OP as quickly as possible, when new info comes in. Work in progress, to compile a list over the next few weeks and months and keep everyone updated. Goal is to make x470/b450 users aware if they will be able to upgrade or if they have to buy a new mainboard.

Take everything with a grain of salt until we have confirmation.

Amd,Fixed VRAM Overclock Issues with my Radeon VII," 

TL/DR: I got the VRAM to go from being stable at 1140 Mhz to 1180 Mhz by raising the voltage at the lowest frequency on the GPU tuning advanced control (808 Mhz) from 739 mV to 811 mV.

Hey guys! So I fixed a ""***sort of""*** issue (really it is a non-issue) I was having with my Radeon VII.

For some background, I work as a drafter for a construction contracting company (I use Autodesk AutoCAD). I use it at least 8 hours a day for just work, plus use my PC for gaming, and then using my PC for the folding@home at night. This is the [link to build](https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/eolziy/first_custom_loop_radeon_vii_i73770k_overclocked/). Since posting this, I even upgraded the thermal pads from the EKWB thermal pads that came with the waterblock (1mm thick, 3.5 W/mK), to using the ***quite expensive*** Fujipoly Ultra Extreme XR-m thermal pads (1mm thick, 17 W/mK). It has been working like a champion since I bought it. I am running the Addrenalin 20.04.2 driver, and it has been working fine.

I have it overclocked. But I couldn't get the VRAM overclock beyond around 1140 mhz maximum, and it be stable. From what I hear, many people have posted getting memory frequencies at 1200 mhz. I thought I was just lost the silicone lottery on it, and was going to take the hit on the investment of the fancy thermal pads.

BUT, I just fixed it. Turns out that raising the voltage on the GPU tuner graph at the lowest frequency would make the memory overclock more stable.

I raised the voltage at 808 Mhz from 739 mV to 811 mV, and low and behold, it passed all my benchmarks with flying colors back-to-back at 1180 Mhz! I don't have any powerplay/morepower mods on my card. So I thought I would let you all know I could get these speeds easily.

&#x200B;

I then experimented with it a bit, and did a pretty big undervolt, 994 mV @ 1801 Ghz (stock max frequency), while keeping the VRAM at 1180 Mhz and the min at 811 mV. And low and behold, everything works flawlessly still! I am blown away!   


Just wanted to share this with you all. I felt super silly after discovering this, and decided to share the solution if anyone else was having issues.  


And after discussing this in another thread, yes, for this works with the Vega 64 to get better VRAM speeds."

To feed its massive computational throughput, the NVIDIA A100 GPU has 40 GB of high-speed HBM2 memory with a class-leading 1555 GB/sec of memory bandwidth—a 73% increase compared to Tesla V100. In addition, the A100 GPU has significantly more on-chip memory including a 40 MB Level 2 (L2) cache—nearly 7x larger than V100—to maximize compute performance. With a new partitioned crossbar structure, the A100 L2 cache provides 2.3x the L2 cache read bandwidth of V100. 

**To optimize capacity utilization, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture provides L2 cache residency controls for you to manage data to keep or evict from the cache.

Amd,Allocation of larger than 4 GB files on GPU memory for 4+ GB GPUs - DAG file sizes,"Hello fellow redditors!

It has been brought to my attention that AMD GPU drivers do not load files larger than 4 GB in GPUs that have more than 4 GB of memory. With the DAG file rapidly increasing and 4 GB GPUs being unable to mine ETH and ETC by the end of the year, I kindly request that someone looks for a fix on the drivers, so that our 8 GB GPUs aren't also useless by then.

Such thing was brought to my attention via the following video:

Amd,Is it really worth waiting for the 4000 series?,"My old laptop blew up last week and needs replacing. I know there's a lot of excitement about the new 4000 series but I'm really quite confused by how these stack up against the exiting chips - not least because some current laptops seem to have 3000 series processors, which I thought were meant for desktops?

Part of the trouble is that I want a model that will run low-end games. I'm not bothered about running CoD at 60FPS in 4K but I do enjoy strategy and platform games and some can push the graphics envelope a bit. As such, I'm quite tempted by the integrated GPUs in AMD chips in the hope they'll save me some cash on a dedicated graphics card.

I have no current plans to do anything else that will push the hardware - some photo editing, probably. The kids may want to do light video editing in the future, but nothing professional grade.

I'm in the UK and there are very few models with the new chips available. The only ones I can find on the market are ASUS gaming laptops which all either seem to have crap screens or be stupidly expensive. And fun as it might be to have all that gaming power, I don't really need it. I have no idea when there are going to be models from other manufacturers out, or how much they're going to be.

So: are these new 4000 series GPUs really going to be worth the inconvenience of waiting likely some weeks for a new laptop? Are they significantly better for my needs, in particular, the built-in GPU (and I understand they offer better power/heat management than existing units)? Or am I safe buying a rig with an existing 2000/3000 series chip and if so, which?"

Amd,How do you check the stability of an overclocked Ryzen 3000 processor ?,"I have been trying to overclock my 3800x for a while now and I have been facing some problems so I decided to ask here.

I realized that the operating temperature has a huge impact on the overclock stability. This causes some problems on my overclocks. After doing an overclock and finding out that it is stable by testing with Prime95 for hours, I decide to change the fan curve on my AIO a bit and BOOM! The overclock isn't stable anymore. Another example is when I do an overclock in the winter, the overclock becomes unstable in Sommer. This wasn't the case with my Intel and 1st gen Ryzen cpus. Is there any way to reduce the effect of the temperature changes to the overclock stability ?

Another problem is the guaranteed stability. My overclock can sometimes run Prime95 for hours without a problem but it crashes in some games.  Does this mean that even Prime95 can't guarantee a stable overclock ? Even if the overclock doesn't cause any problems, can it corrupt the OS files overtime ?

Any help will be appreciated."

* USB-C front header along with the usual USB 3.1 header
* At least four rear USB 3.1 ports on different controllers for my Oculus Rift. 

Desirable but not required would be at least a pair of RGB headers. I see a couple of the premium B450 boards had front USB-C, but it appears this will be more common with B550? Although I don't know what the price points will be.

So essentially, will this RAM be fine or do I need to look at upgrading it?"

1. How durable are the pins on the CPU? Thinking about it has given me a lot of anxiety, and I really don't want to bend them on accident. I'm used to the pins being on the board.

2. How are temps? Does it run hot? I'll be getting an AIO for it.

3. I might have to use the stock cooler for a bit, the wraith one. However, it's pretty scary because I've heard of cases where when people go to remove the wraith from the cpu, the cpu sticks to it or something and gets pulled out of the socket and destroys it. Is this common?

4. What motherboards are recommended for it? Since it seems there is a shortage of x570, I might have to get B450.

Now I know that Justin's wife to-be was killed in a car crash in February, he asked for a refund, they declined because he asked for a non-refundable deposit to be refunded. Legally, they were in the right (from what I can see, honestly, they should have claimed this on insurance and moved on)

Anyway, from there I can find what seems like he has started a slander campaign against Copper Stallion, they then lied saying an Employee killed themselves, he then Slandered them on TV and now we're at the point where the internet is brigading the business?

I've checked all the news articles and the website http://www.justinmontney.com/ which covers the email exchange between the two parties, and from watching the news videos, reading the articles and emails, honestly, I feel like I've missed something where this has gone from ""Copper Stallion are dicks"" to ""Let's utterly destroy their business"""

OutOfTheLoop,What is up with the Mr. Tfue YouTube channel?,"Recently, YouTube started recommending me [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL05N7lagvg) of a man who makes buildings out of clay using primitive tools. They're interesting to watch, but there are a lot of things about these videos that don't add up. His first video was uploaded 9 months ago and he already has 2 million subscribers. The vids easily get millions of views. One has over 126 million. The video descriptions say that he is from ""The United State of America"" and are filled with multiple examples of broken English which lead me to believe he isn't actually from the US. From watching some of the videos, he appears to be all alone, living in the jungle in the buildings he's made. But the way it's edited makes me think he has multiple cameras set up so I have to wonder how he's charging all those batteries and how he's editing and uploading everything. Some of the videos have ""Millionaire"" in the title so is the implication that he himself is a millionaire just doing this for kicks?

I also have to question the viability of the things he's built. Because they're built below ground, meaning if it rains, they'll flood. And he even puts small pools in some of them. You can't expect stagnant water to last long. The descriptions say his goal is to build an underground city, but why? No one is living there. Is this just some art project? Is there even a Mr. Tfue? I feel like there's a lot being done here just to manipulate YouTube's algorithm. Tfue happens to already be the name of a very popular YouTuber and I feel like putting USA in the description is designed to push the video towards US to get more viewers. Putting millionaire in the title sounds like something that might get you more views as well."

Edit: Maybe I need to clarify what I’m asking. Perhaps this is just too obtuse of a subject for my mind to grasp. Specifically, what information about the user is being gathered by the apps and Apple?

It seems as if this app has the ability of to track movements of patients testing positive for Covid-19? If so, how is Apple gaining knowledge of medical records of covid patients?"

AmItheAsshole,Coronavirus Post Moratorium: Updated,"Hola, amigos. It's been a long time since I rapped at ya, but I been workin' for a living, taking what they're giving, all that.

We're relaxing the coronavirus moratorium a bit. The nature of corona related conflicts has changed along with the world. We've largely moved out of concerns over traveling, shopping, panic behaviors, etc. Lots of folks are now facing very tangible interpersonal conflicts as a result of being shut inside with others. We don't want to shutdown any and all conflict where COVID-19 is tangentially present, but rather continue the goal of minimizing the spread of misinformation.

So what's the new standard? Simply put,

#This ban now extends to posts that ask for a judgment relating to possible or potential exposure or risk thereof. Please report these posts.

I will reiterate: Follow your local authorities recommendations and policies for quarantine/lockdown/stay at home/shelter in place/social isolation.

I will provide some examples below, but read these with the understanding that ***this is not an exhaustive list and should not be pointed to in the event your post is removed.*** We simply cannot anticipate every way someone may ask about exposure and these examples are provided to help illustrate the line.

**Examples of approved posts:**

* Conflicts about priority access to internet/tech for school work, working from home, gaming/streaming, etc.

* Financial conflicts because you lost your job when everything closed

* You're butting heads with the people you live with as a result of being stuck together

* Changing household dynamics as a result of you suddenly having to work from home

**Examples of banned posts**

* Can your roommate still bring their SO/friends over?

* You yelled at someone for getting to close to you

* Your family is pissed you refuse to go to someone's birthday/graduation/fuck-it-it's-tuesday party

* Someone wants you to get a job and you don't want to risk exposure

* Posts that will lead to a debate about the merits of lockdown, when/if certain activities will be safe, who counts as an essential worker, and similar.

Please note, if debates or other discussions which lead to the spread of misinformation around COVID-19 occur, they will be removed from comment section.

We hope everyone is staying safe and sane in these times."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting anyone have anymore weddings on our property even though it’s tradition?,"
My husband and I own this beautiful property just outside the city where lots of couples like getting married. Over the past 30 years since we inherited from family we have hosted many weddings as well as other events as the the family member who owned it before us did. We live in the city for our jobs so we would go out there on the weekends for all the events.

Our plan was to continue doing this for another year then we would stop and both retire from our regular jobs and move onto the property.

Since my job decided to make my work entirely online we thought it would be the perfect time to move up our plans. My husband retired,  I’m going to continue working for another year and we’re going to move into the house on the property.

When the whole thing with the virus happened we had 8 wedded scheduled. We of course refunded everyone’s deposits and notified them that we would be closed for events. Since we’ve decided to go through with our plans I notified them and put on our Facebook page that our venue was not going to be reopening.

So far we have gotten a barrage of messages and posts on Facebook with a lot of people upset. 

For example one woman was very upset and talked about how her daughter was going to get married there this spring and how everyone in their family had gotten married there and how she was the only one that isn’t going to be able to get married there now.

A lot of people replied to her comment saying the same thing. That this property needs to stay open and that we are being selfish and ruining so many peoples traditions by keeping it closed.

We don’t want to keep it open. It’s just so much work for us. The property in question also isn’t very big, so having a wedding here twice a month (which is our average) would be very disruptive.

The place people get married is right outside the house and the house itself was used for the wedding and usually has people going in and out of it. We don’t want all these people in our house once we are moved in.

Update: You guys have definitely gotten my husband paranoid. Now he’s pricing security cameras and gate.

I spent the day double checking that everywhere online said we were closed. I also ended up deleting the Facebook page and our other social media accounts. All we have up now is the website up with the closed notice. 

I’m still getting some angry emails, but as soon as I get done talking with the people that want to buy the chairs and other wedding stuff we have I’m going to log off it.

My husband and I are considering having the place open just for some people who want to get portraits and other pictures taken, but that’s it. We’re just not up for any more big parties."
AmItheAsshole,"AITA for telling a girl in my social circle that she's being a bully to the ""neckbeard"" in our group?","I'm (21M) quarantining with my university flatmates. 3 girls (all 20F) and 2 other guys (20M, 21M). 

One of the guys, we'll call Sam (21M) looks like the typical ""neckbeard"". He's largely overweight, wears anime T-Shirts, unkempt facial hair and has spots 

However, he only *looks* like the stereotype. He's not creepy or holier than thou. I've spent time with him and been to many parties with him, he just suffers from sometimes severe social anxiety and low self esteem. 

Well, he went back home for something and I was in the kitchen with the rest of the flatmates. 

One of the girls, we'll call Amy, immediately began roasting Sam by saying ""I'm so glad that ugly neckbeard is gone"" and how she doesn't have to look at him anymore. 

Honestly, I immediately felt disgusted. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from or how they look like. I was once treated like that and it isn't nice. 

I immediately snapped at Amy and said ""You're bullying him, and that's not cool"". She looked at me shocked I confronted her and things went quiet. 

Later my other male flatmate Henry said i was an asshole for interrupting Amy and that she was ""only joking around and having fun"". I told him tht he's complicit and should be ashamed. But I do wonder whether I was an AH for embarrassing her. AITA?

**INFO - Some asking whether he has had creepy behaviour to others. He is definitely NOT a creep, as other girls I know have said. I address this [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gqwr5u/aita_for_telling_a_girl_in_my_social_circle_that/frvxhmq/?context=3).**"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to train my cat to use the litter box instead of the toilet because my boyfriend doesn’t like it?,"Basically my cat is trained to use the toilet bowl, I have two bathrooms in my flat and the cat uses the guest one, it’s always up and clean because the cat uses it and knows how to flush it (sometimes he forgets it), I clean it every day and my cat been doing it for the past 6 years. 

My boyfriend just moved in with me and he hates it, even if we have our own bathroom and barely uses the guest ones, he says it is disgusting and awful, last night we had a huge fight because the cat didn’t flush it’s poo and now my bf is saying that he is going to leave if I don’t litter box train my cat, but I see no point doing it since the toilet is much more hygienic. 

So AITA for not wanting to change my cats habits to make my boyfriend happy?

INFO/EDIT: Adopted senior cat, declawed with aversion of the box and burring his own waste. In the shelter in order to not use the box he would shit and pee on his own bed and sleep on it, thing that decreased his chances of getting adopted, indeed I adopted him because he was in the shelter for 4 years. Toilet training was the way (and only way) for him.

Cat tax edit: Ben before going to work

(Picture taken AT MY WORK, where I had to put his food in the bathroom but it was for roughly three hours, he is a social cat and loves greeting people so I took him to work to greet the children from a school trip, he also doesn’t wear ties around the house. It was a special occasion, I don’t keep his food in the bathroom, this isn’t my bathroom)

EDIT 2: my cat is indoor and strictly followed by a vet, he has no access to outdoors and other cats, the risk of him having toxoplasma is super low and toilet is the only way for him. I don’t advise potty training for cats that have access to outdoors."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to use “hiney cloth”?,"My wife of 6 years has become increasingly into hippie “natural” stuff. She no longer uses drugstore makeup and puts olive oil on her face every day for example (it’s strange, but I don’t really care.) everything has to be organic, fragrance free, etc. not really a big deal to me either way, as long as she still takes modern medicine seriously (like vaccinating our daughter.) so far it’s just been this difference that we live with. No biggie. 

Well lately she’s developed this idea that the asshole is like the mouth and anything that touches the asshole goes into the whole body. She suns her asshole on the roof deck (Imagine a person lying in the sun like a roast chicken) which is weird to me, but it’s a private roof and nobody can see her. She also believes any soap she uses on her vagina/butt is like swallowing soap so she’s been washing both parts with olive oil. I have to admit this is a bit of an issue for me because the olive oil appears to lock in odors in a grainy residue, but I’ve learned from previous situations not to say anything about this. 

Well, she’s taken it one step further by saying toilet paper is toxic and we need to start wiping with old cotton rags she calls “hiney cloths” which she keeps in a wicker basket by the toilet and washes every few days. I’m sorry but no. When I take a shit it takes at least 15 wipes to get a clear white piece of toilet paper, there’s no way I wouldn’t go through the entire Arsenal by 10 AM. Worse yet, she has made our daughter do this too, and 5 year olds are already not great at wiping themselves. Normally she’s fine with me doing my own thing but she’s become very adamant about the hiney cloth. 

To be clear, she washes the hiney cloth and is not asking me to. But I still really don’t want that much poop in our washing machine. 

She has really gotten intense about this because apparently our daughter keeps asking why I don’t use the hiney cloth and she has to use it. I finally snapped and said “ you can feed her all the organic food you want but I will never tell my kid their butthole is their mouth.” I’m sorry but I just won’t. 

She thinks I’m being unreasonable. After all the hiney cloth is just one thing. But come on. I can’t be crazy right?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for doing heavy workouts even though it makes my sister insecure?,"Hi reddit, got a situation on my hands. 

I'm (23M) not a big guy by any means. Hell, up until a few months ago, I certainly wasn't athletic. I'm about 6""2 and 165lbs, and was a pretty ""nerdy"" dude. Spent a lot of time on my Xbox, rarely doing much athletic work.

My sister (21F) on the other hand is very athletic. She's about 5""7 140lbs, involved in many sports. Always has been. She always took pride in her athletic ability. 

So once the l0ckdown happened 2 months ago (in UK), I decided to take up exercise, mainly due to curiosity and boredom. I wasn't concerned with bulking up, so I just ate my maintenance calories but ate high protein (so I'd stay the same weight but gain strength).

I went from being able to do pushups/pressups with 5kg on my back at the start of quarantine, to 2 months later (now) being able to do 7-8 reps of weighted pushups with 35kg on my back (while staying @165lb bodyweight). I can also do weighted pullups with 20kg attached to me, and weighted dips with 17kg.

This wasn't an issue until my sister last week walked in on one of my workouts and saw me doing weighted pushups. She asked me how much I was doing and I said there was 35kg in the backpack. She looked shocked and didn't believe me, so I showed her proof. 

Her reaction after was a bit confusing, because she asked me to stop doing these heavy workouts. I thought it may have been concern for my safety, but instead she said ""it makes me feel insecure"", I just laughed and thought she was playing some weird prank. 

Until my parents later suggested I should maybe stop and that my sister has had so much pride in her workouts, it makes her feel low that I'm doing workouts with much heavier weights than she is capable of (she can only do pushups with a 5kg weight, and struggles to do more). She struggled with depression for a long time so she is now saying that this triggers her feelings of low self esteem. 

I find it unfair because that's not my fault at all. I love the endorphins and feelings of strength I have after working out, so I don't want to just give it up because it makes her insecure. My parents agreed to back off, but my sister later said I'm an AH for not taking her feelings into account. AITA here??"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for using my housemates' expensive clothes to clean up vomit (I hope it was vomit) they left all over my bathroom that they stole?,"I (20m) live in a house with 6 other people, 4m & 2f. We're 2nd year uni students in the UK. The place we live isn't university-owned.

I don't wanna get in to student housing but basically, you live on campus for the 1st year and then you have to move. I had 3 friends and we agreed to move in (3 guys) and then the others moved in with us after we found a house and we advertised spare rooms. The guy (M) and the girls (L and K) are troublemakers. M's dating L, and K is L's friend. They have always been their own group and have been rude in the past, but nothing major.

Our house has 4 bathrooms between us, so it's 2 to a bathroom and then 3 in one. K, L & M share a bathroom, and they don't clean it properly. Their rooms and bathroom is on the 3rd storey alone, so we don't go up there unless we need them, but their bathroom has stunk out the house before.

Because of 'things', everyone except K, L & M moved out of the house early. We've all returned last week to get our stuff, on different days to minimise contact. We intended to renew our lease next year, but the landlord wants to inspect the house before. Part of the returning home process was that we would all clean up our rooms and bathrooms so they would be ready for inspection when it happens.

When I entered the house (I was first to go) it was filthy - it smelled, trash everywhere, nasty. L had agreed that she'd clean the house in general, so I left it. When I went upstairs, I found my bathroom covered in what I hope was vomit. The smell was absoluetly diabolical. I shouted for 3 of them to explain, and they admitted that they'd been drunk and they were 'too drunk' to go up to the 3rd storey, so they just used my bathroom. They said the vomit was 2 days old. It smelled worse.

I demanded they clean it, but they refused, K and M saying that it's my bathroom and it's my responsibility - if I didn't want them using it I should have said (even though I have before) and L refused as she is cleaning the rest of the house. When the argument got heated they all just went upstairs locked their doors. So I went into the laundry closet, all my towels were covered in shit. The wash basket was outside the closet, so I grabbed something that I knew was M's and used it as a towel. I cleaned up the bathroom, it took 3 hours, and I got through a lot of their laundry (I know it was theirs, dw), and left it all in the basket at the bottom of their stairs. I shouted to them when I was leaving that I'd cleaned, hope their clothes weren't expensive. They all ran down and started screaming at me that a dirty bathroom is part of uni life and that what I did is 'illegal', I told them that they should have respected me and that I would be telling the others, as well as warning others from housing with them.

They've been blowing up our group chat trying to get people on side, but everybody is agreeing with me. I know it's immature, but AITA? They probably won't be able to get a close place for just 3 people."
AmItheAsshole,AITA For not apologizing to my roommate after she walked in on me masturbating?,"I know the title sounds weird but it is pretty damn literal.

&#x200B;

I live together with 3 people(Me 23M, Kelly 21F, Jake 25M and Tina 26F) in a very large apartment(Very large for my area that is) We have a large kitchen that is connected to the living room and we each got an individual room with an individual bathroom. The rooms are all quite large, but mine and Tina's are the largest in the sense that there is enough space to have a large bed and your own little living room and little kitchen setup, so essentially they are apartments within the larger apartment which results in me and Tina not actually using the main Kitchen and living room all that much, meanwhile Jake and Kelly's rooms are reasonably large but nowhere near large enough to have their own kitchen and living room setup.

&#x200B;

The reason I explained all that is essentially to say that when home me and Tina spend most of our time in our individual rooms where as the other two roommates spend a lot more time using the shared areas as such when the others need to ask something or whatever they generally go to my room, if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

And that is where this happened, now I had a stressful day a while back with college bullshit, obviously I can't go see my girlfriend with everything going on and figured I'd have some me time, you know. Well while I was busy Kelly just bursts in to ask me where I put the mixer or some shit and well everything was on full display in full glory so to say. I pretty much just started laughing and told her to give me a moment and she started saying sorry and such. Now I am not particularly shy so I wasn't that bothered so I simply told her to knock next time as she should do regardless and I figured that was the end of it.

&#x200B;

Boy was I wrong, see Kelly and Jake recently started dating and Jake is a bit overprotective because he is really easily intimidated, you know the sort that sees a threat in every other male in the vicinity, he calls it protective, psychiatrists call it insecure. Nice guy in general though don't get me wrong.

&#x200B;

Well a few hours later I went to grab my controller from the living room and Jake starts asking me to sit down with him and Kelly as there is something he needs to discuss. Well to make a long story short, Apparently I need to apologize to Kelly for scaring her and to him for...I am still not understanding that one. I started laughing and told them both to get bent, he got angry and told me he was serious so I told them the entire situation was her fault.

&#x200B;

It has been a few days now and they both still want apologies, Obviously Tina started noticing they were acting weird towards me as well and asked me what happened. Well we both shared a good laugh and she had an even bigger laugh about them needing me to apologize.

&#x200B;

All in all I feel like they are acting absurdly but given how firm they are keeping to this apology crap Am I missing something here? Am I being the asshole essentially?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for throwing my partners 30-year old son out of my house after 6 years of refusing to pay rent?,"Good day, Redditors. I am a male (59) living with a lady (59) for 13 years. 6 years ago her youngest Son broke up with baby mama leaving him no where to go. Partner allowed him to move in for a couple of months to regroup. That was 6 years ago. To make matters worse, he took my closet leaving me with nowhere to put my clothes, which have been in a pile on my bedroom floor for 6 years because we have nowhere else to put them. This morning I was out and I passed the County Sheriffs office. I went in and had an eviction order processed on him to vacate before July 1. Partner had a fit and threatens to leave if I go through with this warrant. AITA? p.s. anybody who knows me would tell you I would give the shirt off my back to anyone that truly needed it. I have been pushed and pushed hard here. I pay for the house and everything in it. I’ve asked for little more than being allowed to live like a civilized person with a closet to hang my clothes in."
AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I refuse to share my inheritance with my relatives?,"Growing up I saw my grandfather twice, once at my grandmother's funeral and once at my high school graduation. I figured it was because we lived pretty far away, but in the back of my mind I guess I knew that he and my parents did not get along. He was a hard man. He grew up in the depression, and served in Korea so he was a product of that time.

I went to college in Boston and he lived a few hours away so I decided to call him up. He was pretty surprised I called but invited me out to the Vineyard for the weekend. Honestly he was kind of a dick, but I felt bad for him. He was all alone out there. I kept heading out there once every few months and for holidays. Overtime got used to me and he warmed up. The more stories he told me the more I guess understood why he was the way he was. When I graduated college I moved away but made sure to call him/visit when I could once a week and keep him company.

A few weeks ago he passed away. The other day I get a call from the executor of his estate, and find out he left everything to me. My grandfather started (and later sold) a company in the 60s that some of you are no doubt familiar with. Over 300 million in assets all to me. Not a dime for his children or other grandchildren. Now it may seem like an ideal situation, but this is causing a huge rift in my family with my aunt even threatening to contest the will.

I don't mean to make my family out to seem like some greedy money grubbers who abandoned him only to show up in time for the will. That is not the case. My grandfather did/said some things that are not great and I understand why they would not want to see him. They grew up in that house and I feel it may be unfair that they get nothing, so maybe the right thing to do split the money equally among my aunt, uncle, my mom and myself. On the other hand I did love the man, and I want to respect his wishes. I don't really need all the money, but I don't know if it is the right thing to go against his will."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for eloping? I got married almost 3 and a half years ago!,"Me - (29M) my wife - Laura (26F) old friend - Shawn (31M)

So my wife and I actually got married in December 2016 so this situation is really fucking bizarre.

An old friend of mine recently got in touch with me after we lost contact many years ago and he saw that I’m married. I didn’t tell him this because we weren’t talking at the time and he got really offended that he wasn’t invited to my wedding.

I told him that there wasn’t a wedding. My wife and I were only engaged for 6 months and took our daughter who was 6 months old at that time and eloped. The only people there were us; our kid and our witnesses were the registry office people. We literally got married on our own terms as we didn’t want a huge reception.

Shawn has used the argument that we used to be really close and that I’m an AH for not considering him as a witness even though joke of my family or friends or Laura’s were there. He also said were assholes for just eloping meaning our marriage must be shit. He then brought my now 3 year old daughter into this and I swiftly blocked him. 

I’ve recently brought up this bizarre exchange with my mom and she thinks that Laura and I should have had a proper wedding instead of the registry office reception with our daughter that we wanted. A few others have agreed with her but Laura says they’re idiots for dictating what they think a “real wedding” is and her family and our friends are on our side.

Who’s the AH here?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for buying my own car?,"This is really old (7-8 years) but I'm still getting shit for it so might as well ask.

A few months before I got my driver's license my stepdad had a knee replacement, and couldn't drive for at least 6 more months, and even then he'd have to build up to driving longer distances.

My stepdad then said that he was thinking that when he recovered he'd ""treat himself"" by buying a new car, so he was looking to get rid of the old one. I'd saved up about 8 grand and he said he'd sell me his car for 2. It was pretty new, in good shape, and he'd bought it for \~40 grand a few years earlier, so it seemed like a great deal, but then he told me the catch. During his recovery from surgery until he got his new car, I would have to drive him everywhere. Any place, any time, with no warning needed, so he could hypothetically wake me up at 3am asking me to take him to get ice cream and if I refused then he could take the car back. So I'd be paying him 2 grand to be his chauffeur.

I said I'd think about it, because I did want a car and I'd still have been allowed to use it for myself, but I didn't want to be driving him around all the time. I went out and looked and found a car at a used car dealership for just over 5 grand.

Went back a few days later and bought it outright, drove it home, and mum and stepdad were furious. Mum had her own car, but her work was in the opposite direction to stepdad's, so they were relying on me taking my stepdad's offer for him to get around. I felt guilty so I did take him to work once but I was a new driver and he was loudly backseat driving, so I said I was never driving him again. They asked me to reconsider but I said it was my car so no.

My car lasted me about 7 years and somehow passed the MOT test every single year without fail. I got into an accident last year (not my fault) and it was totaled so I had to get rid of it but it was a good little car.

I live in a town where there's a lot of public transport, so I've not needed the car, but given current events I might minimise my time on public transport when lockdown is over. I mentioned on the phone to my mum the other day that I might be getting a new car and she reminded me of the whole thing with stepdad, ending the rant, and it was a rant, with ""and 7 years later we've not even gotten an apology"". So this is clearly something she's been holding onto for a while. We moved on after that but I'm still thinking about it. Part of me feels I should apologise and the other part feels I didn't do anything wrong.

AITA?

Info: my stepdad's knee took longer to heal than it was meant to. He wasn't back to driving until nearly a year after I got my car and even then he wasn't driving normally, it was building up to bigger distances. Took him about 6 months of building to drive himself to work (so around 18 months total).

Also I'm a girl.

And I did actually say to him when he made the suggestion ""so if you want to go for ice cream at 3am I have to do it?"" and he said ""considering I'm giving you a 40k car for 2k then yeah"" or something along those lines. It was 7-8 years ago so I can't remember it word for word."
AmItheAsshole,"AITA for ignoring my step sister after she made her dad get rid of my birthday present cause it was ""unfair"" to what she got?","Me and my step sister's birthdays are within 4 days of each other but she is a year older than me, since we all moved in together when we were like 3 and 4 we have always shared a birthday which is on mine since its later.  She is at our place 2 weeks out of the month and every easter and christmas and spends summers and all the 3 day weekends at her mom's.  Her mom is a lot more well off than my mom and step dad so she has always gotten way better presents than me.   I don't mind that and I know my mom and step dad try hard to get me stuff too and my step sister doesn't really rub it in.

I do all my school work online now that they school is closed, and I've never had my own computer and have always used the family computer in the living room for all my work.  My birthday was a month ago and I asked for laptop so I could do my work in my room.  I honestly didn't expect one but for my birthday I got a lap top.

Like I said before me and my step sister share a birthday and since he spent a lot on the laptop (about 350) he gave my step sister a card with money that was about 150.  She wasn't pleased with her gift at all, my step sister complained for a full week that it was unfair and then told her dad that she would go live full time with her mom if I don't make it right.  He then got rid of my lap top and gave me the same amount of money which was 150 as my sister and said I can save up and buy my own laptop.

I have been really really mad at my step sister and step dad for this bullshit, she practically manipulated him into getting rid of my birthday present cause god forbid she doesn't get even more fucking spoiled.  After that I have been flat out done with her shit, I ignore her as much as possible.  If she wants to do something with me I am always too busy, if she needs help with something well I'm doing homework or something else I can't.

Recently she wanted help with her chores, cause it was her turn to scrub the toilets and she always tries to pawn it off on me.  I told her to just do it and refused to help her, she kept getting more and more angry at me cause I was ignoring her and telling her to just do it.  She called me a dick and left my room crying, my mom came into my room to ask why she was crying.  When I told her my side of the story she got really upset with me and took away my phone for making her cry and forced me to help her.  My mom also told me to get over not getting the laptop and to stop being so mean to my ""sister"" cause I'm acting like a brat.

Am I really the asshole here?????????"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for being upset I got my art too fast?,"The other day I commissioned an artist to draw my character. I paid $60 for the full body shaded which is a bit pricy (for me) but I assumed maybe this artist takes a long time like 6-7 hours which is why they price it like that, so I understood why. They sent my a sketch not long after I paid and I approved it expecting to wait a while for the finished art. Well what ended up happening is that they sent me the finished artwork early in the next day and I was like that was fast?? The artist said they work quick and plus I got in early on their queue. Out of curiosity I asked them how long it actually took them for the drawing and they said just under two hours..... I know what you’d may be thinking that I should be happy I got the fast service but hear me out. I felt a little bit scammed because I paid $60 only because I thought this artist probably takes a lot of time, so it is worth it to pay a high price for it. But they didn’t even draw for a full two hours... I asked the artist if I could have a partial refund maybe because it clearly did not take that long. They told me straight up no and seemed kinda annoyed with me. Idk I just feel like the price wasn’t justified. I talked to my friends and like half of them said they understood and the other half said It was a dick move even just for asking. But to be fair the ones that said it was a dick move were also artists so they are biased. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to name my unborn daughter after my husbands high school girlfriend?,"My husband (35) and I (31) are about to be first-time-parents as I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant. We found out it was a girl and my husband suggested the name “Tiffany.” I immediately fell in love with the name! I asked him where he got it from and he told me that he heard it while watching a movie and it stuck with him. I didn’t think much of it. We decided that we both loved the name and that it was going to be our little girls name! 

However, a few days ago, my SIL and I were talking (on FT) and we got onto the topic of the name. She mentioned how surprised she was that I agreed to that name because she’d never want to name her child after her husbands high school girlfriend. I was really confused at first and asked her what the heck she meant. She told me that my husband dated a girl named Tiffany from 10th grade until they were juniors in college. While I knew my husband had a long relationship in high school and college, I never knew the girls name. 

My SIL could tell how upset I was and assumed that my husband told me where he got the name from. I told her that he told me that he heard it from a movie and he never mentioned it was his ex-girlfriends name. She apologized and told me that she didn’t mean to upset me. I wasn’t upset with her, though. I was and still am so angry at my husband.

After hanging up, I confronted my husband and asked him if what his sister said is true. He tried to blow it off at first but eventually admitted that it’s true. We argued back and forth for awhile before I told him that I would NOT name my daughter after his ex-girlfriend and I refused to use the name “Tiffany” anymore. 

He tried to convince me that it wasn’t a big deal but IT IS to me because 1) he lied to me about where the name came from, 2) i don’t want to look at my daughter every day and remember that she’s named after my husbands ex-girlfriend and 3) it makes me feel like he still loves her... as far as I know, they’re not in contact and haven’t been since they broke up. 

He told me that I was overreacting, acting like a child and that I can’t change my mind now since I’m due in 5 weeks. I feel hurt and betrayed.

AITA for not wanting to name my daughter after my husbands ex-girlfriend?

Edit: after I finally got him to admit the truth, I asked him why he wanted to use that name in the first place and he told me because he thought it was pretty and that his ex-girlfriend was such a good person that he wanted to name our daughter after her but thought that I wouldn’t agree to it (which I don’t!), so he told me that he heard it from a movie instead of being honest."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a woman to control her children at the dog park?,"Obligatory I’m on mobile, so apologies for formatting 
Where I (23f) live there is a massive off leash dog park with a large trail system. It is constantly packed, especially since it’s reopening with mandatory masks and social distancing. I go everyday with my 3 dogs. 

The other day, there was a woman there with her two children, around ages 3 and 6 from what I could tell. These kids were running around, screaming, going up to random dogs and trying to pet them without asking the owners etc. basically just being loud unruly children. 

Personally, one of my dogs does not like children, and it is pretty common for some dogs to not like children. Some dogs won’t even be adopted out to families with young kids because of this. Now, my dog isn’t aggressive towards them, but he will bark at them when approached quickly. My dog did not have a problem with these kids, he just ignored them, but I was worried the kids behavior would result in a bite from another dog who doesn’t like being grabbed by kids. At this dog park, it is recommended on the rules board to not bring young children, and if you do, to have them controlled. Frankly, it’s just a safety issue. 

After watching the 6 year old go up to the 5th dog in a row and try to grab its tail to pet it, I went up to the mother. I said something along the lines of “hey there, could you try controlling your kids a little more? Not every dog likes children and it’s a safety issue for them to be running around, screaming, and approaching dogs they don’t know without the owners permission”. 

This lady BLEW UP at me. She said something like “how dare you tell me how to parent my children, they’ve been fine every time we come here, this park is for everyone and I should be allowed to bring my kids to exercise my dog etc.” 

I responded that while this park is for everyone, it is first and foremost for the dogs. If she wanted to let her kids run around and scream she could go to other parks and keep her dog on leash. It only takes one dog for the kids not to be fine every time they come here. Every dog has a different history, and it’s literally on the rules board to control your kids. 
She continued to yell at me and accused me of “gatekeeping the dog park” (???) and I just walked away. 

My mom was with me and she thought I was kind of an AH for going up to the woman, and that I should’ve just let sleeping dogs lie (lol). To me it’s a safety issue, and I would hate for the kids to get bitten and for an owner to feel guilt over their dog biting in reaction to being grabbed by a strange child! But now I’m wondering, am I the asshole and was I “gatekeeping the dog park”?

Edit to add: my dog *is not* aggressive towards children, otherwise I wouldn’t bring him to the park because I’m not irresponsible. He will only bark at them if they approach him quickly as a stay away bark. He’s also only 10lbs so he just barks and then goes on his merry way. 

It‘a true I could’ve gone to another part of the park, and I did, but I wasn’t talking to her specifically for *my* dog, I wanted to bring it up for the sake of her children and other dog owners who her kids were clearly annoying and inconveniencing"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my mom I'd move in with my dad if she charged me rent?,"Lemme make it clear I'm not some 24 yr old college dropout with no job or plan for the future. I just finished high school and I'm not even 18 yet. I have plans to start college in the fall and move out once my freshmen year is done if it isn't all messed up by the recent world drama.

This all started when my mom came into my room complaining about the dirty dishes; a few water bottles and a bowl that originally had ice cream that I'd finished less than 5 minutes previously. It was sitting on my bed, and I'd planned to wash it when I got up next.

The conversation suddenly turned to how this was her house and by proxy my room was technically hers along with everything in it, so I was required to take care of it or I would and I quote ""suffer the consequences"" she then proceeded to yell at me saying I'm about to be an adult and she was going to start charging me rent.

Note. That I don't have a job, and any job I've tried to get she has shut down. I HAD a job with my dad at a wing joint, I was going to my first day when she came home and threw a hissy fit about it because she thought it was some kind of power grab from my dad. When I literally just needed a job for gas money. So long story short I don't have a job and I can't get a job because she'll veto it and say no

So I have no clue how I would pay for this aforementioned rent. Which apparently in the words of my brother would be $200 a month because she did this with him previously before he moved out.

I thought about deflecting and saying I would clean it up but I decided I was done with her shit so I flat out told her ""I don't have to live here. I can easily go live with dad right now.""

Now suddenly I'm the asshole, and how could I do this to 'my poor innocent mother' when all she's done is 'support me'. When she was the one who started it in the first place.

So am I the asshole?

Tldr: My mom threatened to make me pay rent when she won't let me get a job, so I told her I would just move in with my dad. AITA?

Edit: I wanna make it clear that I will only be moving in with my dad if my mom STARTS to charge me rent. I am not going to pay to live with my mom, if I wanted to pay to live somewhere I'd live by myself. However she hasn't yet, so I'm still fine.

The job problem basically disappears once I turn 18, because she can't keep me from going anywhere. I mentioned it because I would have to start saving right now if she where to charge me $200 monthly rent the moment I turned that age."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting my child’s natural hair color back,"I have no issue with crazy hair colors and even approved my daughters hair to be colored once for her birthday at three years old. However, that color was chosen specifically so it would wash out within a few days. My ex and his girlfriend keep coloring my five year old’s hair with Overtone and every time she comes back home to me she has a new hair color (our schedule is week on/week off). They haven’t been telling me they’re going to color her hair and I’ve asked many times if they could do a less permanent option because her hair is very delicate. Yesterday she came back to me with the most splotchy hair color imaginable and I finally looked her father in the eyes and demanded that he stop doing this. He doesn’t see the issue because “she asked his girlfriend to do it so they did”. AITA for wanting them to wait until she’s older to start making these decisions and use wash out colors for now instead?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend she can move in with me but not her cat?,"My girlfriend (Anna) and her family adore cats. They have 5 cats. She knows I don't like cats but it's not a problem.

The problem began when we were talking about moving in together after the pandemic is over or at least under better control. She lives with her parents right now and I have my own appartment but I moved in with my parents again due to the lockdown and we miss eachother.

My girlfriend wants to move into my appartment because I got really lucky and pay very cheap rent for a pretty big and nice place, and it's close to the university she goes to.
At first I told her that's great and maybe she can even move in this summer. She got really excited and we have since been daydreaming about life together

Then she told me how excited she is to bring her cat with her. I was taken aback, because this was never mentioned before. I don't want the cat in my appartment, not due to my dislike for cats, but bc I too have pets. 

I have three gerbils.
They are 1 year old and can live up to 5 years. I love those little guys with all my heart.
Right now they are staying at my parents house but when I move out they are coming with me. My mother can't stand rodents and I am happy she even let me bring them.

I told Anna that I don't like the idea of her cat living in the same place as my gerbils. I fear the cat is going to try to break in and gerbils are really delicate and could die from a heart attack. I know that their cats hunt and kill mice so I feel like this is a real concern. I can't put my gerbils in another room, their terrarium is huge and really only fits in my hallway and if I were to lock the hallway the cat could only stay in one room which I think is cruel to her.

Anna immediately suggested to get rid of the gerbils and let her cat stay, since it's a much smarter and according to her more important animal and compared my gerbils to goldfish who don't know what's going on anyways.
I understand her being disappointed because she had been so excited and I was too, but I can't give away my gerbils. We have bonded and so many people treat smaller animals badly on accident due to ignorance. 

I asked her why she can't let her cat at her parents house, it's in the same city and her parents love cats. This angered her and she called me selfish and cruel, because moving to my place would make her life easier but I'm forcing her to choose between me and her cat. And that I couldn't understand the bond between her and her cat because my pets are dumb rats. I was upset and told her that she is still welcome to move in if she wants but her cat won't move in at least until my gerbils pass away.

Everyone I know is telling me that I am an asshole for prioritizing small animals over my girlfriend and getting her hopes up that she could move in with me and then crushing them because I won't let her cat move in as well.


AITA for not wanting her cat at my place?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for choosing the wishes of my husband's ex over his.,"My husband has a daughter who is 6 years old.  We have been married for the last 3 years.  His daughter and I have an okay relationship.  His ex-wife and I are civil.  She really isn't difficult to deal with.

Her and my husband usually co-parent well together.  They are having a disagreement over SD6's hair.  It is long (about 2 inches past her shoulders).  She has thick, beautiful hair.  The problem is that it knots easily.  My husband hates brushing it after baths. He recently told his ex that he wants to cut it off (up to SD's chin).  She told him that she didn't want too, as she loves SD's hair.  Also, she said that her and SD have a ritual every night where she brushes and blow dries it.   
To be honest, his ex takes great care of SD's hair.  Anytime she brings her here or we see them out, SD's hair is always well groomed and clean. 

SD is the ex's only child.  We have 2 more children which makes bed time a little more hectic.  We always brush her hair but not as much as the ex does.  My husband thinks we should just cut it on our time and his ex will get over it.  I used to be a stylist so I do know how to cut hair.  My husband has been pressuring me to cut it.  I told him no, as I think it would cause problems with his ex.  Plus, when I asked SD about it, she didn't seem excited by the idea of cutting her hair.

I think this is a hot button issue and do not want to cause unnecessary drama with the ex.  My husband keeps pushing the issue and told me that my loyalties are in the wrong place.  I guess I am curious if others thing I am wrong for standing my ground.


Edited to add:  some people have asked why I don't just do her hair.  I do try and take care of it when I am home.  I work in the evenings so I am often not here for bath time.  I have tried to teach my husband easier ways but he just doesn't seem to listen.  I will work with her more to comb it out herself."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for snapping at my MIL and saying she’s pushing me out of my child’s life?,"My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 5. She is currently 20 weeks pregnant with our first child and we have been excited.

My MIL and wife have been always been close, MIL raised my wife as a single mom. MIL was also raised by a single mom. MIL actually didn’t tell my wife’s dad that she existed and to this day, he doesn’t know. My wife has no interest in knowing her dad so she says it’s just not a huge deal. I respect her wishes, but it has lead to issues with the pregnancy. MIL and I had a decent relationship until my wife got pregnant. Even before she got pregnant, MIL would always say, “When (wife) gets pregnant, if you leave, I will be there for her.” And since we told her, it’s been a reoccurring theme. It has been made clear by MIL if I can’t take it  and leave her daughter, she will take my place and parent my child. I have no plans on leaving my wife or my child. 

And really, the whole thing has driven me crazy. My wife has said “I know you’re not leaving” but she says her mom feels that they know best with pregnancy and child rearing. I am worried about being pushed out of this child’s life and that it’s a wish of MIL that I will just up and leave, so she can swoop in and be the child’s dad. I have told MIL I’ll never leave but she says “you don’t know how hard it’ll be”. 

Recently, we were on Zoom and MIL said something to the effect of her being the dad if I left. I told her no, I’m not and she needs to cut it out. She said, I won’t get how hard it is until the baby’s born, etc, etc. I said “yes and that’s just what you want, for your daughter to be abandoned and sad, that’s pretty sadistic.” This offended MIL and apparently my wife too. Apparently I don’t understand that MIL has abandonment issues because her dad left her. I said I sympathize but she cut one man out of knowing his kid (my wife’s dad and her) and now is doing the same. They are painting me as the devil here.

Am I being the asshole?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for buying a nice cooking set for my daughter but not my son?,"This will be a throwaway, I’m an older person and I’m curious about what younger people will think about this situation. 

I have two children, a girl and a boy. My daughter loves to cook, has been cooking since she was about three years old. As she got older, she even helped my wife and I out by making dinner a couple of times a week. It’s a passion of hers. 

When daughter was gearing up to get an apartment, my wife and I took the time to get her some lovely Le Creuset pans. My wife got one for each color of the rainbow. She cried when we gifted them to her, they are her pride and joy. We used to have dinner at her house once a week, the pots and pans look brand new, they will last her forever. 

My son never cared to learn how to cook. My wife tried endlessly to try to help him learn how to make basic meals, but he was never interested. I’m pretty sure that he would burn ice. He has never taken an interest in cooking.

My son is currently moving out into his first apartment. As we are helping him move, my wife and I decided to help him get a sofa and a bigger TV for his living room (both he and his roommates have small TVs). While this costed less than the cookware, it was something they needed. We got him a couple of pots and pans from target to take with him. 

As we were moving him in, he asked where his nice pans were. My wife and I were both confused. He started getting upset, recalling the nice set we got his sister when she moved out. My wife and I laughed about it. We asked him what he would need them for if dominoes was going to be doing most of his cooking (thinking he was playing around about them). He actually got very upset by this and told us that we were playing favorites. 

We pointed what we did buy him, but it was no conciliation. We ended up leaving his apartment, and he is actually not speaking to us! We didn’t think that this was a big deal, but his behavior is making us question that. Is there something that we are missing here young people of reddit? Are my wife and I assholes for not buying my son expensive cookware?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to support my parents financially?,"I should give a little backstory here: growing up, my parents were extremely wealthy. I watched my dad blow his money on a mansion, sports cars, and unnecessary purchases he made to show off his wealth. He owned a very successful and stable business, but decided to gamble it all away when he sold the company to start a new one that completely failed. We lost everything. 
We moved out of the mansion and for the rest of my childhood and adolescence, we were so poor that we barely had money for food. I got made fun of in school for having old clothes that didn't fit me. My parents still would have cleaning people come over and clean our house and I would watch them pay them in cash as I sat there hungry. They did everything they could to keep up with their appearances while neglecting my needs. 
Now on to today, their financial situation has improved thankfully, and I make a significant amount of money: more than they are making. My dad keeps making comments about how he is so glad I'll be able to take care of them now financially as I don't  think they have anything setup for retirement. They keep making frivolous purchases and are still being irresponsible with their money. I have a lot of financial goals I want to achieve and I have not factored in paying for their living expenses in their old age. I am bitter that they blew all of their money and the money that they did have, they did not use to take care of me growing up. I have worked hard for my wealth and I do not feel as though they deserve a significant share of it. AITA for not planning to support them?"

Throwaway and all fake names btw.

So Sarah (24F) , my (25M) girlfriend (now ex I guess) had always had these random... 'style changes' I guess?

Like one day she'd wear skirts, or a simple dress shirt and the next she's wearing shorts and crop tops,  halter tops, tank tops etc. so her style changes *a lot.*

It bothered me, since she is very attractive, and whenever we'd go out, she gets stares and has even gotten hit-on, because they think she's single.

So, she wanted to get highlights, and her sister had this store-bought highlight thingy, and before the pandemic she borrowed it to do it, and I managed to convince not to do it, so she forgot about it and now she remembered and wanted to get dark purple highlights.

I rather prefer girls with un-dyed hair, it's just a preference so I told her that I'd rather she not do that, since it wouldn't really look good on her, and she'd ruin her hair. She told me that she thinks it'll look good on her, and plus she'll be able to just highlight them brown, or fully dye her hair back to brown if she doesn't like it.

I told her, that I wouldn't like it, since it'd ruin her hair, I didn't mean to come off controlling. She just shrugged. And we went to sleep after that, I thought it was the end of it. Then the next day, I woke up to her making breakfast with *purple highlighted hair.*

I asked her why she did that, since I told her it wouldn't look good (I still didn't like it) She said she had a 'change of heart' and that it shouldn't matter what she looks like cause personality matters

Then I said to her, she should have told me if she was going to do it, and she asked why, and I told her I'd rather know if my girlfriend was going to damage her hair. I should have chosen my words better, cause she got all defensive and told me that I shouldn't have a say in what she does with her hair and how I 'manipulated' her last time. So amidst the whole fight, the breakfast got burned  , and we were too busy arguing so it was too late to save the food and we had to throw away food.

I was tired so I said out of anger that 'This wouldn't have happened if you had just listened to me and stop being a child.'

Sarah then started yelling at me *again* saying I should cook for myself and that she shouldn't have to be my maid. I told her that she does those things by herself, I can cook and clean, but she does that so I see no reason to dismantle the system, and she likes cooking. Then when I thought the fight was over, and that she would make breakfast while I cleaned the bedroom (yes I do clean the rooms sometimes) she made breakfast for herself, ( not me)  and told me she's leaving and 'she's done with me', and now she's at her friends house.

This happened a few days ago, but I feel like she overreacted. So AITA reddit?

Edit-Holy fuck, okay, I get it, I'm the asshole. Stop threatening me. Also by 'dismantle the system' I meant that she liked cooking, and and I barely cooked (she used to nag that I'm doing everything wrong. I didn't mean it in a misogynist way."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for kicking my mother out of my house,"I'm (26f) and was born and raised in Nigeria but eventually moved to the US. I have a 5 years old son who I had outside of marriage.

And if you know African parents, you know they disowned me. Very recently I rekindled my relationship with my mum and sister and they came to visit me in January.

First few days were alright. But my mum tried to interfere in my parenting. It's worth mentioning I'm completely dependent on myself and the father is in no way involved in my son's life. So I try my best to make sure my son is always okay. My mother offered to replace the babysitter and i agreed.

Corona happened and lockdown, so I started working from home and spending more time with my mother, sister and son. I noticed my mum spoils him too much but I didn't say anything because well she just got involved in his life and it's her first grandson.

I'm on my laptop doing some work and my little boy comes in asking to take my phone to play. I told him his screentime was over for the day. He throws a tantrum and I say no very bluntly numerous times.
 
He starts screaming, crying and telling me my mother is better than me. My mum walks into the room and tried to persuade me infront of my son, at that point I got very frustrated and felt disrespected. Again I say ""no means no"", I made sure my son know the meaning of this ever since he was younger. My mum then stares at me and says ""oh don't tell me you're teaching your son all this feminist talk"" I tell jer that's my son and I choose how to raise him.

Now at this point, to an african parent, it's like i just commited 3 homicides at the spot. I'm never the type to talk to my mum or any elder like that but she was getting to my nerves. 

She then proceeds to tell me that's what the west had taught me and she regrets ever giving me the chance to leave nigeria to become this person she doesn't recognizes anymore.

I value my morals so much and I'd never willingly put anyone at that situation so I just sucked it up and apologized. 

A few days later I found her instigating my son against me and constantly telling him not to take me seriously and if I say ""no"" he should just insist more and he'll get what we want. 

It got too much therefore I told her to either stop interfering in my personal choices on raising my son or she's welcome to leave my house.

She got so angry and screamed at me packed her things and left. I have no idea where she and my sister are right now but I know they have enough money to keep them going through these days so I don't feel that guilty about them not being with me.

I thought about it too much and I think I'm really compromising my culture and morals since I've came to America and I'm not sure I did the right thing. My aunties from back home all called and showed disappointment in what I've done. I tried to dial my mum and she completely ignored me. And now my son doesn't want to talk to me and refuses to eat and says I'm the bad guy."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for saying my brother isn't going to get a younger woman just because he has money?,"My half-brother (38M) didn't have a ton of luck with women when he was younger, because he spouted off a lot of confrontational, awkward stuff (interrogating them about how many guys they've slept with, etc. his ex told me all about it when I was in my mid-teens and it really pissed me off) He also apparently treated multiple ex girlfriends like a maid. I heard a lot from him as he got older about how he would get a hot younger girlfriend as soon as he got successful - fast forward a few years, and he IS successful financially, but can't seem to get past a few dates with women of ANY age.

I obviously am not on the dates with him, but I have a feeling he's still doing the same rude, entitled stuff he always did. Even if he isn't, I think most women pick up on someone having that FORMER attitude. Now he switched it up and is complaining about how women just want a hot guy instead of one who will provide. I'm 14 years younger than him so there might be a generation gap, but the other day I lost it at him and said: ""women don't have to be tied to a jackass just because he's a provider, and you're not going to get a woman my age unless she's a desperate gold digger. Most of us don't like old dudes just because they have money"" (something along those lines, could've phrased it better). My mom and step dad are calling me now and telling me to apologize, but I feel like he needs a reality check. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister she needs to lower her standards.,"My sister is 37 and has been mostly single for the past 3-4 years. She's a doctor and is working like 70 hours a week on occasion and the hours can be brutal. However, she takes time for herself and she's quite attractive (if that's not creepy to say). Plus, she's very intelligent and well-read and can discuss a ton of different things.

She's been complaining to me about her dating life a lot lately, saying how she can't find any guys that want to date her that she also wants to date. I have obviously asked her the reasons, and the main ones are she's looking for someone close to her age who's also career-driven like her, and more importantly, he must also be her intellectual equal. And he must also not be unattractive - to her at least.

I'm usually in ""hang in there and keep trying"" mode when these discussions happen, cause I don't want to upset her, but last weekend - after what felt like the 100th time she was starting that discussion - I tried to gently explore the subject that her expectations might start becoming a bit unrealistic as she ages.

She exploded on me.

All I told her was that, in my experience, finding a man like the one she's looking for is really hard, cause smart, hard-working, successful guys in their mid-late 30's or early 40's are generally all married by that point. So maybe it's time for her to lower her standards and go for one of the many men that do pursue her. 

She got angry and told me she would go for them, but they all get intimidated by how more successful she is than them and that turns her off. So she now just disqualifies them from the get-go, cause she knows that it's a waste of time and said that ""I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about"".

And then I got a bit defensive and we had a fight that went off on 3 billion different tangents. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my brother I don’t want him and his kids in my house any more,"I have exotic pets, large reptiles and small mammals.

His kids come over and start going in cages and leaving them unlocked and giving me a heartattack trying to find my pets they released (surprisingly none have killed each other yet) 

I told him he needs to leep a better eye on them or Im going to ban them from my house.

Today they caused my tegu to drop his tail.. which is extremely hard to do they don’t drop it as easily as your random house gecko it takes a lot of trauma

So I kicked them and my brother out and said they aren’t welcome back until they learn to respect me and my animals.

My mom called me and said Im being a massive prick it’s “just a lizard” she actually called him a snake but..

First off I’m expecting around a $600 vet bill from this as I have to get him x-rayed to make sure it dropped in a way that didn’t harm him and if you know anything about tegus you know they have the intellect of a 3-5 year old child.

Second this isn’t the first time they were warned.

Third my brother told me to just buy locks for my cages, It’s not my responsibility to pay to have my cages locked and i don’t want the additional hassle of having to lock and unlock cages twice a day and some cages don’t even have a way to install a lock


Me-23M brother 32M his kids 10F and 8M 

AITA

TLDR: brothers kids don’t respect my animals so i kicked them out

edit: i love how people are making assumptions about my family being sociopaths or having other issues, or assuming I’m a bad pet owner for not reacting sooner (I did react I never said what I did the previous times good on y’all to just assume I ignored the previous behavior) and people acting like me being emotional is undeserved.. which honestly i hope someone kicks your dog so you can talk to me again about “being emotional”. 

Some of you are just commenting based on the info given, thank you. Some of you are making a lot of assumptions and honestly that’s unhealthy of you.

At the end of the day they may be pricks but they are still my family.

My mother raised us all with a very very old school mentality when it comes to animals and sadly it stuck with my brother and stuck to my nephews. I was hoping that being around me with my strict rules and education would help but it did not. I love them but at the end of the day I have to take action to protect my animals and that means punishing them if my brother won’t do it.

They enjoy coming over because i have the animals, im a good cook, and I have lots of video games. 

So hopefully they learn that if they can’t follow rules and respect my animals and by extension myself they can’t have the nice things. Maybe they learn and I teach them respect because obviously my brother is failing on that regard, or they don’t. Either way Ive done my part in keeping my animals safe, and can say Ive tried long enough and hard enough to do my job as their uncle to teach them."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend about my biggest fear and unintentionally offending her?,"My friend was concerned for me since the lockdown has started and on a video call told me of her concerns and that she was worried about me. I appreciated the fact she was so caring for my well being as it came from a good place and thanked her but reassured her that I was fine. She said to me that I wasn't fine as she had noticed that I'm being paranoid about my weight, now more than ever and was fearful incase I was developing a problem. Luckily I'm not, I haven't been doing anything to harm myself as I know that would be stupid and have only been feeling low. I will repeat, I have only been feeling low and haven't been doing anything.

My friend kept asking me to talk to her and I kept saying no that it is a private internal conflict I'm trying to get over. She kept pressing saying ""I'm your best friend, you know you can talk to me"". After that I thought she was right and that she (of all people) is someone I can trust. So I revealed my biggest secret that I have never disclosed to anyone except my psychiatrist. I have a bad phobia of getting fat. To explain, it stems from an awful experience I had that I did end up getting fat and became a shell of who I was. I'm terrified of getting fat because I now associate weight gain with these awful experiences. I never want to be that way again. It is completely internal and I don't project onto others. I told my friend all of this, actually went into more than I can say here, she is aware of these experiences but she didn't know I associated getting fat with them. She did know I was seeing a psychiatrist but didn't know why.

My friend changed from concern to anger, she was very offended saying how unbelievable I was and how that is the vainest shit she has ever heard. She said that not only was what I said vain but incredibly offensive to larger people as I think it is a bad thing. I said that I don't project and that this is entirely about my own issues and trying to work through it. My friend didn't listen and started getting angrier saying that I was a heartless bitch making out like being fat is so terrible. She ended the call and now I'm left thinking was what I said really that bad. Although I'm thinking this, I'm not going to apologise for how I feel. She did ask and I did answer under the assumption that she would understand as my best friend. So AITA for telling her and unintentionally offending her?

Edit: before anyone asks, no I do not have an eating disorder and don't have a history of eating disorders. My psychiatrist and I have spoken about these things before and she has said it herself that I clearly understand that eating disorders aren't the way to do things and determined I'm low risk in developing one.

Edit 2: That bad experience was the only time I got fat, I wasn't a fat up until the experience. After I got out of it I lost the weight but I am genuinely terrified of getting fat again because I associate all the pain and grief with fat. 

For example; If I put on 7 pounds I get anxious, feel extremely low and refuse to let people see me out of fear I'm back to the way I was. All the negative emotions come back.

QUESTIONS:

1. Is your friend overweight?

She is but says she isn't. I tend not to bring it up.

Edit 3:

I went into full detail as to why I have this fear to my friend, I can't say here because it violates multiple rules and is unpleasant.

Edit 4:

I'm not skinny, I'm average. Last time I weighed myself I was about 80kg (12st5 or 176lbs) and I'm 5ft11. That was about a week or 2 ago.... I don't weigh myself often."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to sell my car to help save my girlfriend’s dog?,"My girlfriend has been out of work since late March due to the pandemic. I’ve been working 3 days instead of 5 since early April so money is kind of tight for the both us. Her dog recently got sick and after a visit to the vet she learned that it will need surgery and further treatments afterwards my girlfriend doesn’t have the money so she’s asked me to trade in my car and get a cheaper one. She got her car appraised and even if she sells it it won’t be nearly enough to cover the surgery. I drive a pretty nice sports car and selling it will be enough to cover the surgery and I’ll be able to buy a used car later. 

I told her I needed to think about it and she got very upset. She’s had this dog for 8 years and she’s very attached to it. She asked what there is to think about because it’s a living thing over a car. She also pointed out how I didn’t even work for the car and my dad bought it for me as a graduation gift ( He just paid what I still owed on it but I used a lot of my own money from my part time job to make the down payment and made payments for 2 years)

After thinking about and discussing it with my family I kind of think she’s asking a lot of me. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with selling my  car. Her sister called me yesterday and told me how depressed she’s been because her dog is suffering and is probably going to die. She said I’m an asshole for choosing a car over a living creature. I think this relationship with her is over and we’ll probably be breaking up soon.

Edit: Just so there’s no confusion and I can get a fair judgment I won’t be without a car if I sell my sports car. I’ll be able to buy a used car and be able to pay for the surgery. She’s upset that I’m choosing a luxurious car over a more modest one when it could save her dogs life. I apologize if that wasn’t clear in the post

Edit 2: She just posted something on her story about how she’s losing a boyfriend and a dog and that she wasted 3 years of her life so I guess we’re no longer dating? She’s told some of her friends about this and while a lot of them took her side one of them texted me that if she were my that she’s being unreasonable and that if she was my girlfriend she would never ask me to do something like trade in my car. So there’s that I guess"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to tutor my brother's kids until he apologises?,"I'm a teacher. I have qualifications in all core subjects (English, maths, science), and I teach primarily English at my school, as well as occasionally maths and science, and tutor in all of these subjects.

My brother has always believed in ""those who can't do, teach"", and my career has always been a hot button topic because he says that it's ""not that impressive"" and that it's ""not like you're going to change the world"". His favourite critique is saying that I'm not a ""professional"" in my field(s) because I'm ""just a teacher"". He also likes to brag about how he runs his own company and built it up himself, when it's actually a family business he inherited from our dad. He's smart, but always talks about how meaningless exams are as he only earned basic passing grades and now doesn't need anything he learnt in school.

And now my nephew, a 15 year old taking his GCSEs next year, has just been informed of his predicted grades based on mock exams. His highest predicted grade is a 3, which is the equivalent of a D grade and technically categorised as a fail. And that's the highest, all of his other grades are predicted at 1 and 2, which are E/F/G/U grades. My brother is now nervous because it seriously looks like my nephew is going to fail all of his exams and have to resit GCSEs. His brother, age 12, has similar results.

My nephews, having seen their mock results/predicted grades, didn't care at first because, like their dad said, ""I won't need them once I finish school"". My brother has finally realised the gravity of the situation and his wife (my sister in law) has made him sit all 3 of his kids down and say ""you need your GCSEs, you need to do well in school, I am going to ask aunt OP to tutor you all.""

The youngest is bright, and she'll do fine without help, but the older 2 need help learning basic revision techniques, studying the material they need to know, and generally prepping for exams, with my older nephew being the more urgent case and the younger nephew having a few years to fix it. Both boys are currently anxious because my brother has told them that they will fail and that where we are you have to have a minimum of a C in at least English and maths to get a job most of the time.

My brother called me and explained their grades, what he'd told them, and asked when I can start. I said that I'd start as soon as he admitted he was wrong or aplogised for making fun of my career. He then told me to go fuck myself and hung up. I've since received a call from my sister in law, who I've been friends with since before she and my brother got together, saying it was hard for him to ask for help, but wanting an apology is pushing it, and can't I just do this for my niece and nephews who need help without requiring my brother wound his pride further.

AITA for wanting an apology before I start?

Edit: just to be clear - I do fully intend to tutor his kids, whether I get that apology or not. I wouldn't let the boys fail such important exams, and I believe my niece, who is 10, has the ability to pass the 11+ exam (which her brothers failed) and get into the school I teach at, which I want her to do because I think she would thrive here. I just went into this thinking it would be really nice to get some sort of aplogy from him and that somehow escalated into me wounding his pride, so if it looks like I'll never get that apology then I'll do it anyway, but if it looks like an apology is a possibility then I'd like to hold out until I get it."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my daughter to shut up and that not everything is about her?,"We have 4 kids. Our son who is 34 and married, our daughter 32 who is single and our fraternal twins (m and f 25). Our son is in a long term relationship and our daughter is engaged to be married. 

Right now we are all planning the wedding of our younger daughter Anna. Our other daughter Sarah has been...... Not supportive to say the least.
We tried to cut her some slack at the beginning because Sara's long term partner of 4 years had cheated on her a year prior. They had talked about marriage so she always thought that she would get married before Anna.

So when Anna announced her engagement 2 months ish after Sara had split with her partner and Sara went crying to the bathroom, I asked Anna for some sympathy. Even if that had dampened the mood Anna didn't seem to mind much.

But this has been a trend since then. Everytime we bring something up that has to do with the wedding Sara starts pouting and we end up Consoling her and talking about her. I wanted to stop enabling her and suggested she get some counseling. Because while it was very hurtful it could not stop her from living her life. She blew up at me and accused me of favoritism. I was very stunned because, while we have done many things wrong, we have never favored one child over the other. We gave them different kinds of support but the same kind of love (e.g our oldest was always the weakest in math so he got a tutor in school while our youngest son didn't get a tutor but he got classes in guitar because he was keen on that).

So here I might be the asshole. After that fight following happened. Where we are everything is opening up again. So the bridal store where we had an appointment called us and reassigned it to last Thursday, with restrictions. We could be 2 people besides the bride and we had to minimize the dress choices to 3. Well of course Anna asked Sara if she wanted to come with us and Sara just started berating Anna that she had been a bad sister for these last few months, that she should be ashamed, that she was selfish etc. I tried defusing the situation, reminding her that it was not fair what she was saying. That she was speaking from a place of hurt but that she should not lash out on her sister. Sara kept going screaming, crying etc. Anna started crying and even our sons came to look what was going on. It got so much that I slammed my hand on the table and said very loudly (not screaming)to shut up, that not everything in this life was about her and that we had been as patient as we could offering an open ear and everything that was in our hands to ease her pain but that we would not stop living our life's because of that. Sara called me a bitch and stormed out.

I feel awful . AITA?


Edit : I thought this might be important. We don't talk all the time about the wedding. It has been a more frequent topic in these last 2 moths especially but before that it was very sporadically.

Edit : wow this got kind of big. I went to bed after just a few replies. I am reading every single one.


As for one question that keeps coming up. The things with my sons is comparable because my oldest really stressed himself out with math. Would study hours with no result. So getting him a good tutor was life changing. My younger son has always been an over achiever in school. He didn't really have a subject that he was weak in. But he constantly overworked himself and stressed himself out. Which is why the guitar lessons come in, they were an outlet for his stress"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my SIL a 'fat fuck'?,"Just want to say first that it wasn't supposed to be an insult.

So we've been staying with my father in law and my sister in law. My SIL is a bit on the overweight side and since she's a stand up comedian, she often uses that in her routine. She's very comfortable in her body and always has been according to my husband.

She tends to joke around and would say this like ""Get a fat fuck some breakfast"" when we're cooking and we always break into laughter. It's just her thing. The problem is that she's now trying to convince my daughter to eat through her cravings. Whether she's craving a bunch of chips and soda or whatever big meal she's feeling, my SIL is promoting it. Her 'logic' is that our body wants what it wants. I hear all the body acceptance and I'm glad my daughter is starting to care less about what others think about her weight but this is ridiculous and unhealthy.

So yesterday we were up late listening to my FIL's stories and my daughter said she felt like some waffles and ice-cream. My husband told her she can have in the morning but then my SIL jumped in and said he must let her have it since she's clearly hungry. My husband spoke some more and then she turned to mt daughter and told her not to listen to him because he's judgemental so i jumped in and said something around the lines of ""That rubbish is unhealthy [SIL], do you want [daughter] to also be a *fat fuck*?"". 

Why I said it? Well I wanted to reprimand her from trying to overrule my husband and I but I didn't want to make things awkward so I thought I should add a joke at the end to keep things light. Her joke. I didn't expect her to take it as an insult but she did (everyone else laughed) and went to her room. Now she's been acting snappy with me and barely wants to be in the same room as me. My husband says it was asshole-ish but I didn't mean harm so it's fine. Aita?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for flipping someone’s comment about me being gay into them being gay?,"Sorry if the title makes no sense, but I’ll do my best to explain it. 

So basically, my friends dad always comments on things in my life but makes it like things only happen to me because I’m gay. Here’s an example: I’m studying law, her dad said that I’m studying law because “gay people like fucking bad boys” - meaning I only want to be a lawyer so I can have sex with clients. I currently have a cold sore, he said it's because I'm always sucking dick. If he finds out I'm reading a book, he'll tell her that it's ""probably a gay porno mag"". It's stupid stuff like that. 

But it really annoys me. At first, it didn't, but then it didn't stop. I also don't know why my friend tells him this stuff - like me reading a book isn't something worth telling your family about. She's told me that ""he's not homophobic, he just doesn't like seeing it."" (I know that's an assholish thing to say, that's not what I want to know). 

In retaliation, I've ended up saying stuff back like ""your dad is just sad that I didn't represent him when he was in trouble with the law,"" ""I got the cold sore from him, he should probably get an STI check,"" or like ""I thought I recognised your dad on the cover of the magazine?"". He doesn't find it funny, and he calls me a dick head, or a ""poof"". My friend also knows I don't like people commenting on my sexuality, or people talking about me when I'm not there. 

AITA for flipping his comments to make him sound gay too?"
AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not donating my eggs to my dad and stepmom, also going no contact with stepmom?","My dad (58) divorced my mom (58 too) 10 years ago, she got custody of me (24F) cause she made more money and is able to provide a stable home for me. Mom never remarried. He remarried my stepmom (441) two years ago and she’s a very nice woman. They’re very much in love and there are no hard feelings on any side of the family.

At the beginning of the year, my stepmom called me to tell me that she’s heartbroken cause she can’t have bio-children. She and dad have been trying, but they couldn’t conceive because she was infertile after many doctor’s visits. I think she didn’t want to accept that news, so she went to others to have someone tell her that the tests are wrong.

While I’m close with them, I’m not comfortable with knowing that type of intimate detail.

Stepmom told me that she’s looking into in vitro and she’s always wanted a child like me. I don’t consider myself special, but she wants me to be a mold for a biological child. She asked if I could consider donating my eggs to her and use dad’s sperm to make a child with the closest DNA match to them. I don’t understand her logic.

Dad is obviously against it and so is mom, but stepmom doesn’t think it’s wrong because it’s not like we’re fucking.

This dropped on me after a week of back and forth between us, she wouldn’t let it go and wants me to reconsider.

I was super uncomfortable when she mentioned using my eggs and dad’s sperm. Then it reached inappropriate when she insinuated that sex even crossed her mind.

She roped my dad’s side of the family in the matter. They’re religious (old beliefs) and believe in patriarchal. Dad doesn’t have an heir to take the family name because they don’t see me as worthy of being the head of the household.

They’ve been bombarding me with messages and calls for my selfishness, saying I’m depriving a good woman of a chance to be a mother and denying my father’s right to have an heir (mom & dad agreed to one child). The family is accusing mom of shoving her western independence view on me when I was a child.

I’ve since cut contact with that side of the family and stepmom. I’m too sickened by the thought of it. Things are awkward between Dad and me, so I went low contact with him.

Now, I’m starting to think if I’m making a big deal out of it. She’s right, we’re not doing anything inces\*uous. I know I have the right to say no (but really guilty for crushing stepmom’s heart), but am I overreacting by blocking stepmom too?

Lay it on me, Reddit. I built a thick skin from dad’s family. It’ll hurt differently from objective strangers, but I need it.  Am I the asshole?

Edit: stepmom's 44, not 441 years old.

Info: many of you mention the legality issue. My stepmom is from the same country as my dad, she shares similar beliefs with his family's religion. I'm not aware of a lot of the details of her plan, she only asked me to donate. I should've put in that she wants the 'child' to have her country's citizenship, not the U.S citizenship. She has access to IVF in her homeland, but I didn't think it would raise many comments about legality. It's why I mentioned my dad's family's patriarchal beliefs. Dad, stepmom, and his side of the family only have green cards. They have access to their country's healthcare, but she's not letting go of the possibility of me. I don't know the laws of their mother country, I was born here and I never stepped foot in the other country. I couldn't put the info in due to the character limit. I'm so sorry for the missing information."
AmItheAsshole,Aita for telling my boyfriend his masculinity was fragile after accidentally telling his friends he likes to be pegged,"My boyfriend loves to be pegged and I thought his friends knew. He invited two of his friends over and they noticed my strap on(I must of forget to put it away). They asked what was that for and I said for when I peg him. His friends laughed and thought it was a joke until they realised I wasn’t joking. Then there was some awkward tension in the room and then my boyfriend asked them to leave. He was really mad and said that his “boys” don’t need to know about his sex life and that they are going to make fun of him. I told him his masculinity was fragile and told him that his friends are immature. He left our apartment and said he was going on a walk until he calmed down. 

Aita for calling him out

Edit: ok I understand  I am an asshole you can stop commenting now

Edit 2: well he’s kicked me out and says he’ll think about our relationship while I’m gone so I guess all of you where right"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for speaking in a different language on the phone with my parents?,"I'm not a native english speaker and my parents are immigrants. They don't speak the language fluently so whenever I'm talking to them on the phone I have to speak our native language. This however upsets some people, who for some reason feel uncomfortable about this.

In particular one of my ex-roommates told me that she was irritated by me speaking another language in our house and that it felt like I was shittalking her (which I have never done...I'm not the gossip-y type and I have more important things to talk to with my parents on the phone than my roommate).

I tried avoiding this by going outside whenever I wanted to talk to my parents, but even then sometimes I couldn't go outside (it was raining or similar circumsances) and people outsidereacted even worse to me talking in another language on the phone (one guy insulted me and spit on the floor after hearing me talk on the phone).

What am I supposed to do? I just see it as a private conversation with my parents...they're both nice people, just a bit old."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my friend to dye her hair for our wedding?,"I am getting married next month.  I WAS very excited, but then the pandmeic happened, and everything has been chaotic.  I've never been married before, so there is still some excitement there, however, there have been minor spoilers all along the way.  Back to the story!  Our wedding is just around the corner, so I've been busy making sure I get all the small details done.  Because of this, I haven't been on many social media platforms in a while.  Last weekend, my fiance showed me a picture of one of the girls in my wedding party with very bright purple hair.  She loves it, as the post states that, and it really does look good on her.  I was shocked by the choice in color, as I've known her for many years, and she has never dyed her hair a color that wasn't considered natural. I thought on it for a couple of days, and finally decided to call her. I told her I loved her hair, was happy that she loves it, but at the same time, would prefer that it not be that color for the wedding, and that I would cover all expenses.  I explained that I do like it, however, during the ceremony she will be right next to me, as well as in most of the pictures, and, while I don't take offense to the color, I would like the attention to be on my fiance and myelf, and that I feel her choice in hair color will take away from that. She became extremely defensive and upset, and refuses to see my side, or understand my feelings on this.  We talked for a bit, she explained her feelings and reasons, and while I understand where she's coming from, I still would prefer her to change her hair color. I offered multiple solutions that wouldn't require her to dye her hair again, but all attempts made by me were shot down.  The conversation ended with her saying she had to go and hanging up on me. So Reddit, AITA for asking my friend to change her hair color for our wedding?

&#x200B;

EDIT - Since this seems to be a common theme in the responses, I feel the need to clarify a few things:

1. People have assumed she's my bridesmaids, but she's our officiant.
2. The reference of the attention being on my fiancé and myself was made as far as us looking back at our wedding pictures.
3. I would normally NEVER ask someone to do this, BUT I am fairly conservative, and this is something completely out of character for her, which she, herself has admitted.  She said wanted to try something new and different.
4. I did not ask her multiple times, I asked her once. I offered multiple solutions, most of which  would allow her to keep the hair color but would also compromise to the conservative aesthetic of the wedding. 
5. Some of the solutions I offered:

\-I would pay to have her hair taken back to her prior color AND to pay to have it taken back to purple.

\-I would pay for a powder ""dye"" which doesn't dye the hair, it conceals the color and washes out.

\-I would pay to purchase a wig of her choice and have a salon put it on and style it.

AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to give back the jewelry my ex gave me,"So a few years i was with this guy who liked to spoil me with jewelry and trinkets. Not once did i ever ask for them, i would go over to hang out with him and hes give them to me. In the time we were together he gave me a few gold plated bracelets, some heart necklaces, raw amethyst earings from his florida vacation and a gold plated engagement ring. We got engaged just before i moved out of stay. A couple months after moving in he started to ignore all my messages and after three months of this he finally messaged me saying that hes been cheating on me and that its over between us. He was very cold about it qnd then he asked for all the jewelry he gave me so that he could give it to his mistress. Including the ring which he claimed was his great grandmother's (isnt true, he used this to guilt trip me. He got it from walmart) i got pissed and told him he wouldnt be getting a thing from me and that instead of ignoring me like a coward he should have just told me straight up before cheating and hurting me so deeply. He then went on to get his mother to try and guilt me to give up the gifts and i started to ignore them. He messaged me again just a few month ago that i was a heartless bitch and because he didnt have the ring he promised the mistress she left him

So am i the asshole?

Edit- since some people are telling me about laws regarding engagement rings i do want to clarify that the rimg he bought forcthe purpose was not labled as an engagement ring by the seller and i only know this because i looked into the ring after we broke up. Does that make any difference or would these laws still imply with it?

edit 2- in light of the legality to the ring ill try and reach out about sending the ring back"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not having a maid of honor anymore?,"So this happened about a year ago, when I got married.

I got engaged in February 2019. I told my oldest/lifelong friend and asked her to be my maid of honor. She was super happy and said yes. For context, we grew up together and lived together years ago, but we've gone long periods of not really talking or hanging out as our lives took us in different directions. But we have a lot of history and always considered each other ""best friends"" so it made sense to ask her.

She got super excited and she started sending me tons of messages every day of flower arrangements, bridesmaids dresses, venues, etc. I told her i wasn't ready to make any firm decisions or seriously start planning since it was a ways away, and my fiance and I are not traditional wedding type of people so most of that stuff wouldnt be necessary or a big deal to me. I planned for the summer of 2020 so my fiance and I would have lots of time to plan for and pay for it. 

Then in March 2019, a month after we got engaged, I got pregnant. My fiance and I decided to get married before the babys birth (it was important to me), and preferably in the first trimester before I was really showing (everyone knew I was pregnant I just didnt want to be super pregnant in my wedding dress). So we decided on a small, 20 person, all family and 4 close friends including my lifelong friend, ceremony in a local park with a lunch at my fiance's parents house after. 

Because it was so small, we no longer needed any of the stuff she had reseaeched about, and we decided to cut the wedding party. When I told her, she said ""so I'm not your maid of honor anymore? Am I even invited then?"" I told her we just weren't going to do any of the traditional wedding stuff, people could come in Jean's and a t shirt and it was all super informal. But she was the only non relative I was inviting from my side so of course she was special to me.

She got upset and barely said anything to me about the wedding after that. Never asked me about my pregnancy or anything either. She texted me 15 before the ceremony telling me she was just leaving her house and showed up at the end of the ceremony. To this day I know she holds a grudge. So, AITA?

ETA: Thanks for your input everyone! I agree that I should have considered the title of MOH to be more important to her than I did. I thought making her a MOH in title when there was no best man and nothing to do would seem like a pity title (which honestly it would have been, considering we decided we didnt want any traditional things and would have done it just to appease her), but maybe it would have been better as I'd already asked her. 

I was going to ask her during the ceremony to sign as a witness but she was late and missed that part. But she didnt know that beforehand so I didnt include it as she didnt intentionally not show up to do it, and I didnt tell her after either. 

But anyway, I dont think I deserved her reaction, but i understand her hurt feelings and do owe her an apology for that for sure.

Thanks everyone!"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting a pregnant woman in front of me in the line ?,"I (F23) am currently staying at my girlfriend’s (26) apartment and yesterday she wasn’t feeling well. She had really bad cramps, was throwing up and had a really bad headache. We were out of medicine and groceries so I went out to get some. 

I picked up the medicine and went into the grocery store, trying to get to the checkout as fast as possible. I was really lucky that there was no line and was already unloading my cart when a pregnant women asked me if I could let her in front of me. Normally, I would have said yes but her cart was bursting and I had to catch the next bus. Maggie has a car but I don’t drive it because of insurance issues. I really didn’t want to wait for the next bus because I didn’t want to leave Maggie alone for too long and I really didn’t have that many items. I wouldn’t have gone grocery shopping in the first place but the pharmacy is right next to the store and we really needed a few things. 

I told the lady that my girlfriend was sick at home and I would hurry up packing the groceries into my backpack. The lady started screaming that I shouldn’t treat her like that and that young people nowadays don’t know how to behave. She yelled that she needed to sit down and that I would take to long packing up my things. I ignored her, paid and left. In the moment I felt like I was right, but now I‘m overthinking it. My gf is touched that I was so worried about her and the lady was just plain rude. But what if she was really feeling unwell. 

Was I the asshole here ?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling strangers off for petting my cat,"I live on a quite dead end road with a large front garden, the garden is 'open' and by that i mean there is no wall or gate separating my garden from the public path in front. The grass just stops and then the public path begins.

I've always had the neighbourhood cats wander around my property ( I have a cat of my own too) and tend to leave food/water out in the back garden for them on their travels.

Since quarantine I've noticed people ( mainly parents with you children) spot cats in my garden an walk over to pet them. It never really bothered me as they would only step a foot or two on my property and try to call the cats over. But some will walk straight over to my door! 

One guy had the cheek to sit on my front garden and watch as his 4 year old daughter played with my cat that was sunbathing on my door step!

I opened the window and tried to politely tell they guy that i didn't appreciate him walking/sitting on my property to pet my cat. The guy tried to guilt trip me by telling me that his daughter always looked forward to seeing my cat and that my cat would never come over when they tried to call it. I got kinda annoyed at that response and told him that he shouldn't be teaching his daughter that its okay to trespass.  He also got annoyed and said i was being 'stupid' and its not like they were doing anything wrong  ( To be fair to the guy he was really calm while we talked)

I insisted that he leave and he did tell his daughter to stop but she upset that she couldn't stay longer.  He just looked at me and said 'Happy now?' before leaving. I feel like such a dick for making her cry but at the same time i'm really uncomfortable with having strangers wandering on my property. Was i an ass-hole? Is what he was doing actually trespassing?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for convincing my step daughters to move in with me and their dad full time?,"Formatted on a mobile so sorry for the wall of text.

Quick background, my partner and his ex-wife amicably split 5 years ago and they agreed she would have legal custody of their 2 girls. He then met me, we have had another child and we decided to move near the girls mum so we could have them 50% and they could have a relationship with the baby, that was 2 years ago.

Since we have been in close contact it has disturbed me that she borderline neglects the girls - all within the realms of legality, but it bothers me. Her house is filthy (not judgemental just honest - dog poo left on carpets, bread left to go mouldy in bags), she cannot manage money at all, and is declaring bankruptcy now for the third time in her adult life. The girls never have to do homework at their mums, and they are essentially left to go slightly feral. It was a BATTLE to get them back to house rules when they have had a stretch at their mums. 

Over this time I have been encouraging them over as much as possible. For the last year we have had them closer to 75% and behaviour is SO much better. The youngest has asked to move in and we are setting up her room. The eldest has said that she can’t move in because it would effect her mums benefits and her mother has said that she might be homeless/ destitute - I’ve essentially encouraged them to move in anyway. I don’t care that this woman in her late 40’s is a garbage fire, I don’t want her to drag the girls down with her.

Their mother has said to us before that having the girls there is the only thing that gets her up in the morning, but she is such a mess, I don’t want the girls spending their formative years living with her, she has issues that need to be addressed and maybe her girls moving out would trigger her to help herself a bit? Or am I taking away this woman’s lifeline?! She is not an awful person, just a bit of a shitty/ irresponsible parent. 

Ive obviously had many many talks with my partner about this, he wants them here with us too, but because he just wants his girls to live with him again. He feels more guilty about potentially pushing his ex off a mental ledge, I think we both could benefit from the Hive Minds opinion."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing a lie detector game?,"My parents got this lie detector game thing that supposedly checks your heart rate, brainwaves, muscle tension, and breathing to generate a percentage of how likely you to be lying/telling the truth. They're all hooking themselves up for 5 minutes each and everyone can ask as many questions as can be fit into the time frame. 

My family has a pretty good relationship. I'm not going to pretend I don't have stuff I'd rather keep to myself but I know my siblings have a lot more to hide. I don't need a toy to know when I'm being bullshitted and I'd prefer to not be put on blast, embarrassed, and asked compromising questions for 5 minutes straight. 

Apparently me refusing it so vehemently is making everything awkward and I'm pouting. I think it's a horrible idea for them to be doing tbh, but they can do whatever they want and I'd just rather not participate. 

AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my wife she should just formula feed,"My wife always complains about breastfeeding. First her nipples were always hurting, and now she always talks about how she never gets a minute away from the baby because it feels like the baby is glued to her chest. 

The other night we got in an argument because she wanted to go to the store and she said there’s milk pumped for the baby if she wakes up and gets hungry.  I told her not to worry about it and I’d go. She snapped and said she always has to stay home with the baby and never gets a minute alone. She was saying how she feels lonely and it feels unfair, how I don’t understand how all of her meals are always cold or she has to scarf them down, and how I don’t understand that she always has to wake up with the baby and even if I were to bottle feed the baby, she’d still have to wake up anyways to pump to prevent engorgement.

I got tired of the nagging and told her she needs to just formula feed and stop bitching about breastfeeding. She had the option and she chose to breastfeed, why is that my fault. I told her if she’d just formula feed then I could help more, but she keeps saying that it’s better to breastfeed and that I’m fully capable of helping her with the milk she has stored in the freezer, even though I was under the impression that she was trying to stock up for when she goes back to work. 

Once again the excuses started so I said either formula feed or shut up. Now she’s mad at me and she hasn’t talked to me in a few days unless it pertains the baby. I told her I was sorry if I hurt her feelings but I guess that wasn’t enough."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling out my friends delusion when she said people have told her about her weight and said she and I are the same?,"My friend is severely overweight, I do worry about her and tried to say nicely about her weight in the past but she gets very defensive so I don't do that anymore. I left her to it, if she isn't going to listen then there is no point. Last time I have mentioned my concerns was 3 years ago. Ive known her for 10 years, in the last 3 years I did put on a significant amount of weight and lost it all (was a UK size 10, went up to a size 18 and lost the weight and now a 12/10), my friend has put on weight too as she went from a size 12 when we met and is currently a size 22. She has not lost any weight and does not have any medical reasons for the weight gain (I noticed it's since she moved out of her parents house that this has happened).

Something that I've noticed is over the years, she has started to convince herself that she is smaller than she is. This has raised alarm bells for me, it's all well and good to accept yourself but to outright deny reality is a problem. She would post selfies of herself and her friends tell her she looks ""so skinny"" and say ""omg you look like a size 12!"" And she actually believes that. She has called me saying about how so many people jave said she looks like a curvy size 12 and says ""I know I am and these people know it too, it feels great"". She has said countless times about how we are the same size, how she has lost so much weight and has an amazing diet (she sends snapchats of everything she makes, the food is incredibly unhealthy and an extortionate amout for one person) and shames fat girls who are the exact same size as her because she believes she is smaller than them. The level of denial is now completely delusional. 

So we were on Facetime talking about preference. My friend then said ""You know why I wouldn't fuck a fat person? Because all I see is what I use to be and think it's gross. Not like us, we put in the work and are slim attractive women and I don't want to be with someone like that"". I had enough because it is almost every day she says stuff like this so I said ""I'm sorry I'm going to stop you right there, you need to look at yourself in the mirror and be real with yourself. You haven't lost any weight, the exact opposite has happened and I'm sorry but you sould like you are deluding yourself. We aren't the same and the fact you think we are is really concerning to me, you aren't slim, you're really overweight and I don't know why you keep talking like this. It's worrying me"". My friend did not like that and hung up the call and started texting me that I'm jealous she gets complements and I don't and how I sound like a jealous jerk. Her friends clearly know about this and have started calling me shit and saying I should be ashamed and apologise. I don't think I need too, I'm not going to pander anymore. AITA?

Edit: any time any topic of health comes up she finds an excuse to justify it. Like struggling to walk up asteep hill, I know it's because I dont walk as much and may have been impacted but my smoking (I quit and haven't smoked in 7 months), she says it's purely down to her smoking and that she is healthy other than that.

Edit 2: whenever the topic of weight comes up, I change the topic to avoid saying something that maybe upsetting. This time I didn't because of a few reasons:

1. She is shitting on people who are the same weight as her. That's not okay. To say you aren't attracted to people for weight is fine, that's a preference, but to say that you are attractive and these people aren't when you are the same size just sounds bitchy to me.

2. She isn't being healthy and it has concerned me for a long time. The level she is going is ridiculous especially considering she shits on other people like her. It's all good to be happy but why lie to yourself and be horrible to others to be happy, that is an unhealthy mindset.

3. She has been talking like this constantly, I try to bite my tongue but I can't let her keep going down this rabbit hole.

Edit 3: of course I'm concerned about her health! She is my best friend and like a sister to me. I don't want her developing problems or dying young.

Edit 4: for the people saying ""you aren't concerned with her health and seem more bothered that she said she is the same size as you"". That is to show the level of denial she's in, we are no way near similar and she doesn't appear to recognize that.

Edit 5: I personally don't give a shit if someone is happy being bigger, good for them. The concern is the fact she is living in a fantasy to be happy. That IS NOT accepting yourself, that is the exact opposite."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for peeing in a tupperware?,"Last night my partner had a uni exam that went quite late. I cooked dinner and we ate it upstairs in bed.

This morning I saw that he peed into one of the tupperware containers we keep food in after finishing his dinner. I told him it was absolutely repulsive because that's where we keep food. He said it shouldn't matter because it's just salt water and hed wash it out. I told him it was disgusting and he should throw out the container or mark it because I dont want to use it anymore. 

He BLEW UP and told me I was overreacting and using anger to get my way. He then scrubbed the container and mixed it in with the other Tupperware so I couldnt mark it. 

Now we aren't speaking. He says my reaction was way over the top and all guys do this. I say its gross that he peed in the container and even grosser for trying to hide it from me so that I have to use it. 

So internet people, AITA?

Edit: because people have been asking about the bathroom. We have one, but it's very far away and cold where we live. He has peed in various containers multiple times recently, but always throw away containers (or so I thoight?)

Update: I spoke to him and he still thinks I overreacted. Last week I left food in the fridge too long and it went moldy. He cleaned it. He brought this up and said it's way more disgusting and unsanitary than pee.

Update 2: I threw away all the tupperware. He got mad at me for messing with his things and said he knew exactly which tupperware he peed in, he just wanted me to calm down. I dont entirely trust that but now hes made me get the other Tupperware out of the recycling and scrub them."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my roommate I won't live with her if she has a baby?,"So me (26f) and my roommate (27f) have lived together for three years. We both go to medical school together and are close friends more than casual roommates. 

Well my roommate has dated this one guy, also in our med school but one year above us, since we both started. They are pretty serious and have been together 3 years. 

During these three years they have had several pregnancy scares all which have ended with nothing coming from it. She always tells me about them and afterwards we always joke about how it's a good thing I don't have to kick her out. 

These not the only times I've brought up not wanting to live together if she gets pregnant. If we are talking about her future kids I usually say ""just wait until after school because you know I'm not helping you take care of the kid."" These conversations have always been light-hearted but I always thought my point was clear, I didn't want to live in a place with kids. 

Well recently my roommate found out she is pregnant. Currently she is weighing whether or not to have an abortion or have the baby. There are a lot of things to consider -- we are in the middle of med school which is a high stress environment with long hours and tons of studying. Her boyfriend is going to be starting his residency in another state and won't be around to help. Her family lives in another state. 

 So one of the things I thought important to make clear was I wouldn't be living in the apartment if she decided to have the baby. Basically I said,  ""look I know we have talked about this before but I just wanted you to also consider how you are going to take care of the baby. I'm not going to live in an apartment with a newborn so you need to take into consideration realistically if you can juggle living by yourself with a newborn while going to school full-time."" I also made clear that while I was more than willing to help her emotionally, I wasn't going to help with childcare. 

Well my roommate blew up. She told me I was an AH to even bring up moving out at a time like this and that no real friend would abandon her for getting pregnant. I tired to make it clear that I wasn't kicking her out of the apartment, that I would be more than willing to move and help her find a new roommate/new housing for her and just the kid. Our lease isn't up till August so we would have till then to figure something out. I just wanted her expectations to be clear -- that I wasn't going to be around to play second mom. But my roommate thought I was being selfish and said I was a bitch for bringing it up before she even decided if she was going to keep the baby or not. 

So basically, AITA for saying what I said? Or should I have waited later to tell my roommate that I wouldn't live with her if she had a baby?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to let my overweight friend ride my horse?,"For background, i have 2 horses. Both are older (mid to late 20s), but one is very old (nearing 30), small (just above pony size and just under 1000 lbs) and has some back and hip issues. She is still in great shape for her age, is very muscular, and still enjoys riding. We trail ride up the mountains near our barn, usually 1.5-2 hours a ride, and they can be difficult and steep, but she does great with me (I am taller but weigh around 115 lbs). 

When I bring friends riding, they ride the smaller, older horse and I ride the younger one. This is because the younger horse is very sensitive and not beginner friendly whereas the older one is not sensitive and great for all levels of riding. Because of aforementioned issues, I am selective about who I let ride her as it’s difficult for her to carry too much weight, especially up the steep hills and for an extended period of time. 

I have a friend who is well over 200 lbs, does not know anything about horses, and asked to ride with me. I said no and was honest about why, but still offered for her to come groom them and spend time with them on the ground. She went straight to the body shaming tactic, I was skinny so I don’t understand, the horse is fine if she’s always galloping around with me, bigger people deserve to ride too, she’s shorter than me so it evens out, I’m gate keeping horses, etc. I just told her my horse was an animal with limitations, not a machine, and that I’m not going to sacrifice her welfare to spare her feelings. She was furious and we haven’t spoken since. Some friends (who all re also not into horses) think one ride would be fine and I’m being an asshole about her weight. I strongly disagree, I even agreed with her that bigger people can ride, they just need a horse suitable for their size and my horse is not that. So, AITA?

Edit: thanks for all the responses guys! This happened a few months ago, but it does get brought up from time
To time still so I was curious to see what this sub would think. 

I understand a similar story was posted not that long ago. That was not me, I just joined reddit this week and I’m sorry for the redundancy but I didn’t see that post beforehand.

Edit 2: I love sharing my horses with my friends and wish I had bigger, younger horses so I could take everyone riding! I have many friends who have never ridden before because of weight, some are in great shape and still too big for her, some are overweight and too big for her. Those friends have enjoyed coming to visit and loving on them on the ground, and that invitation was extended to this friend as well. She’s not too big to ride in general, she would just need a horse suitable for her and unfortunately neither of mine fit the bill. Her size and other issues unfortunately severely limits who I can take riding."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling out a friend on not acknowledging how lucky she is?,"I will keep this short. Seven friends and I were on a video call the other day catching up on each others' lives. Of the seven, four are married, three have children. One friend, Julie, was gushing about her promotion at her corporate job, saying how she really worked hard for it and she's happy they are finally recognizing her worth to the org. I immediately called bullshit and told her instead of lying about hard work, she should acknowledge that she is incredibly lucky to be where she is. Julie has had everything handed to her on a silver platter. She graduated from a top university with no student debt because her parents paid her way. Despite how she acted in high school and college and the reputation she developed, she still found someone who was willing to marry her. She has two children she conceived with no fertility issues, and her pregnancies have been relatively uneventful. Contrast this with the rest of us who are struggling with student debt, unemployment, failed relationships and fertility issues. It just upset me that she was acting like she had surmounted some incredible challenge, when she was an internal candidate and got a recommendation from her boss. Most companies would rather promote a mediocre established worker than hire outside the org, and while that may have not been the total reason she was promoted, I'm sure it played a role.

She got pissed at me, told me she wasn't going to apologize for the life she was living, and that I had no right to try to shame her. She left the call and we haven't spoken since. My other friends have told me that I sounded bitter, and that I should have spoken to her privately instead of confronting her on the call while she was in the middle of celebrating. They have all drunk the Julie-Koolaid so it didn't faze me that much but a guy I've been seeing told me I did sound confrontational and hostile. He also told me about this site, so I'm here for a judgement. AITA?

I am editing this to say that while I may have been harsh with how I said what I did and the venue I chose to say it, I still stand by what I said. Julie has had all the privilege in life, and she is ungrateful for everything. And that is all I will say. "
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my father-in-law to mind his own business?,"I (27F) work full-time and my husband (28M) is a stay at home partner. That means I'm the breadwinner in our relationship, but that's fine. It's a role we're both comfortable with me in and I hate, hate, **hate** chores anyway.

Recently my father-in-law has been making me uncomfortable with his comments. FIL has a habit of making 'jokes' about things my boyfriend has done around the house. He will often comment on my SO's FB posts and pictures with comments like 'another day sweeping the floors?' and calling him a 'domesticated maid'.

We recently had them over for dinner and my husband did an amazing job prepping the house and slow cooking the food. I didn't help out at all, since I was at work all day and I arrived home to him having done everything.

When my FIL found out my husband did the cooking, he straight out asked why I hadn't helped. When I told him I'd been at work, he told me that he would never let his wife, my SO's mother, host a dinner party entirely by herself and would at least prepare a side. The big difference between my FIL/MIL and me/my SO is that his parents both worked full time, which isn't our situation. My FIL looked at my SO and told him 'you know you don't have to live like this'.

Here's where I might be TA. I'd had enough and snapped at him that our situations were very different. And I said that I actually didn't appreciate his attitude to my husband's lifestyle and he had no right to criticise either of us when we're both happy in our choices.

As you can expect, it didn't go well. My in-laws left early and things have been weird since. My husband says that he wishes I'd hadn't spoken up and next time to let him deal with it. But I struggle to agree since he always lets his father walk all over him and sometimes his father is criticising me too.

AITA for standing up for me and my husband against my father-in-law?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister she shouldn’t have kids?,"So my (20F) sister (18F) doesn’t have any kids however we were discussing trans kids and my sister said that if her kid came out to her as trans, she wouldn’t accept them. My sister has not always been the best but recently she gotten worse. Using the word f*ggot, using gay as a synonym for shitty, fake throwing up at gay sex scenes on tv (note: this isn’t a twelve year old being disgusted by any sex scene, she only does this with gay sex scenes). As a bisexual this has been really hard for me to put up with so after she made the trans comment, I turned round and said ‘you shouldn’t have kids then and if she did that, that’s how she would lose her kid’ (as in the kid would stop talking to her once they could). My mum just told us to stop having this conversation. AITA for telling my sister to not have kids?"
AmItheAsshole,Aita for refusing to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend after she wet the bed,"Yes you read that title correctly and no I’m not dating a 5 year old. So about a week ago my 20 year old girlfriend wet our bed and I haven’t been able to sleep with her since. After the incident she cried and was very embarrassed and I told her that it doesn’t matter because it doesn’t change my opinion on her. That night I told her that I was sleeping on the couch and she was hurt but understanding. But now she’s claiming that it’s been a week and that I should sleep with her but I’m still feel not comfortable with sleeping with her. She says me not sleeping with her is making her insecure even though I’ve reassured her that I still love her. 

I was just wondering aita also is it healthy for her to wet the bed(this is the first time in our 9 month relationship that this has happened)

Edit: I’ve realised I was in the wrong but my girlfriend says she doesn’t want to share the bed with me now, which I understand, what can I do now to make the situation better. 

Edit 2: reading these comments is making me worried about my relationship. I think I was grossed out because of my own immaturity and my girlfriend shouldn’t have to put up with that. I realise what I’ve done might make her feel embarrassed around me so what could I do to fix that?

Edit 3: I’m fully aware am the asshole so please can you comment some advice because I don’t want to throw our relationship away because of this.

Edit 4: she’s ignoring me saying she doesn’t want to talk to me. I would say she’s being immature but you guys would kill me in the comment section."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for making “fun” of my fiancée’s beliefs?,"First of, I’m a scientist. I tend to believe in scientific things. If it cannot be proven by the scientific method, then I simply don’t believe in it.
 
Apparently, my fiancée really got into astrology a couple months ago, after we got locked in. Okay, that’s fair, it’s a tough time. The thing is, she’s pretty much a hypocrite. She’s an antitheist, and regularly goes into online discussions and with my parents and points out how ridiculous religion is. I tried to point out the irony here, but she doesn’t see it.
 
I just told her it’s a bit hypocritical of her to make fun of organized religion while she believe that objects light years away have any significant effect on our personality. She just called me an asshole for not being a supporting fiancée.
 
I am a bit socially “slow”, but I’m not on the spectrum. Am I missing something? AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not forgiving my friend after he humiliated me on a party?,"
I have been very overweight my whole life peaking at 200kg (440 lbs). I managed to lose 50 kg (110 lbs) at some point but over time gained it back, lost it, gained it and so on in a never ending cycle. It was never really an issue for my friends, no one ever mentioned it. When I had courage to change my bad habits I would mention my plans to my friends on our Discord server occasionally, but they just ignored it or just accepted my choices without further interest. It was fine for me though, I never expected anything, I just wanted to share. 

Last year I gained much weight over a very stressful period in my life and had 190 kg (418 lbs) again which shocked me.
I managed to lose 30 kg (66 lbs) over 4 months, but didn’t share my success openly because I once weighed less. 

It is the day of the party, I feel fit, strong and am full of positive energy. After all, Ive been dieting for 4 months and lost a lot of weight. I was proud of myself. I just felt good. 

The party (50 people) was a blast. Later in the night we were playing some card games, someone started the topic of losing weight. We discussed some methods and my friend (Lets call him R) disagreed with me on something. It was actually no big deal, he was drunk though. So it was like 3 am, there were about 20 guests remaining, everyone sitting on a big long table. So now he started to criticize my weight loss, how I lost and gained and lost and gained over the past 10 years and how I am absolutely not qualified to give any advice on losing weight. I took offense to that but remained calm, I knew he was drunk so I just made a joke. He exploded after that, everyone stared at him and all of a sudden he started berating me. How I always post this stupid meals, doing stupid exercises, how I am still fat, i should look at myself, i look disgusting. But then it got so out of hand and actually ridiculous that I started laughing after he said he won’t support me anymore. 

What support? Yes, apparently he supported me over all those years by occasionally thinking about me, not being negative regarding my diets/exercise and praying for me. So I should be thankful.

I stood up and went outside for a moment. The party was ruined for me so I decided to go home. I went back inside to grab my jacket. The host, our mutual friend „B“, was standing next to R. I walked over and wanted to thank him for the party and R started AGAIN with his barrage of insults. B just stood there watching in disbelief, I just said „What a great night“ and left. 

2 hours later R sent me a text that he was sorry and he was kind of an ass. I just answered with „yes“.

B said to me after many weeks of silence that the air seems kind of strange since then and that I should forgive him. He just was drunk. I was like „duck that, I don’t give any sh about him.“ 

So now I am the asshole for „disrupting“ our friendship."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my daughter (16) watch anime anymore?,"Hi Reddit, a few days ago I had to put my foot down and stop my daughter from watching anime. This needs some context as I don’t want people to think I have an issue with the medium or Japanese culture. 

So my daughter, Marianne, has been pretty obsessed with anime since she was 12. At first I didn’t see a big issue, I was scared about the social ramifications because my older son, Silvio (19), used to tell us about the kids in school that people made fun of called “weebs”. I was scared Marianne would become one of these people but I held my tongue because my wife was of the opinion that children will do what children do. My first problems with her animes started when during our dinners she would start by what she called, thanking for the food in Japanese. Silvio said he saw her do it out in school once which scared me. This was weird but wasn’t the end of the world but, not long after she started wanting to get into what she says is “cosplaying” where a persons dresses as characters from anime I guess. She showed me prices for whatever it is she needed to buy and it was absurdly high. She eventually got her own job with her brother at a local country club so she got to buy her own stuff which was fine until she finally finished her costume last week. What I mean is the costume was finished and she was happy and I was trying to bond with her so I asked her questions about who she’s meant to be. This was a mistake because she described to me that her character was from a show with so much goddamn incest like it was no big deal. I was mortified, I knew she watched some weird stuff but incest was taking it way too far I mean she has a brother like wtf. I told her that from now on she’s forbidden from watching those shows and she flipped out calling me an asshole. My wife was mostly weirded out but compared it to how much porn nowadays relies so much on incest while my son just said he knew she watched things like that and found it creepy. It’s been a few days since and she’s still really upset so Reddit, AITA???"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for blocking a kid with Down Syndrome's shot?,"This happened a little over a year ago, but people still bring it up and are pretty divided over it.

I (M17) am on our school's varsity basketball team. We have another guy (M18) who has Down Syndrome who is also on the team (he sits in both JV and varsity games). We all love him, he's a super spunky kid with a lot of energy who loves watching us and doing whatever he can to help the team. Unfortunately, he forgets things very quickly such as basic in-game rules and lacks a ton of motor skills which leads to him not receiving a lot of playing time. However, his parents stress to the coach and to us as players that we are to do whatever it takes to treat him like a member of the team to the point where it actually gets pretty insane. A quick example: we used to make the last 5 minutes of practice letting him shoot and feeding him balls. He had a great time with it, always smiling. His mother complained to the coach because she felt that it was ""dehumanizing"" and that other members of the team were not given special privileges, so he shouldn't. I personally think that's insane. 

During a scrimmage once, he was put in, but all he wanted to do was shoot. There was a loose ball that he picked up on defense and instead of bringing it back, he tried to shoot at the opposite basket. I, who was on his scrimmage team, went and blocked the shot, and then gently reminded him that it wasn't his basket and told him I would take the ball up the floor and let him shoot at our basket. He agreed pretty happily, didn't seem upset at all. He was fine and normal for the rest of practice. He's a happy kid. 

Later that night, my parents, the coach, and I got an email from his mother in a very angry tone. She basically said I was wrong for blocking him and that I should be suspended from a couple future games. My parents were angry and thought I should've just let him shoot. Some other guys told me that later, and I had to write an apology letter to the guy, who seemed perfectly cool about the entire situation. 

I still wonder, was I TA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for Calling Out a Coworker for Poor Zoom Etiquette?,"TL;DR: Boomer joins a team of young professionals on Zoom, behaves badly due to cluelessness, and constantly causes technical problems. The annoyance boiled over and OP lashed out at him. Now OP is being accused by team members of being mean even though they all agreed with me that Boomer was annoying.

So we've been working from home and having daily team meetings with 15+ people. There is a coworker who is both older and a latecomer to the team, let's call him Boomer. We have decided on team meeting rules at the beginning of the arrangement. And I guess Boomer doesn't know about them. We also have a FB group that Boomer isn't invited to. Not that we have anything against him, it's just that nobody wanted to take the first step to invite him since none of us know him  well.

Boomer left a very bad impression on his first day. He was late to the meeting since the host forgot to add him, and proceeded to explain the situation to the group when we were all in the middle of a task. He constantly forgets to mute himself when others are talking and remarks to himself (we agreed on no talking over the microphone, only communicating through text chat, and always raising your hand if you need to speak). We tried PMing him and ask him to mute himself or raise his hand, he would comply, apologize, and make the same mistake after his next turn to speak. Half the time he would ignore our PM altogether as paying attention to both video and chat is obviously too much for him.

Since Boomer was late, doesn't know the rules, and is just clueless with Zoom in general, he is not only slowing us down but annoying all of us significantly. I posted in our FB group after the first day that if he kept this up I will chew him out. And I received unanimous likes and positive comments.

After 2 meetings of putting up with his incompetence, I finally had enough and yelled at him. I told him that if he cannot handle Zoom then he shouldn't be working on this team and he needed to start following our agreed-upon rules or GTFO.

I expected my teammates to back me up but none of them said anything. After the meeting, the host called me and said I was too mean and I needed to apologize to Boomer. And that Boomer had opted to work via email instead of Zoom. But I was only saying what everyone in the room was thinking. And we tried dealing with him politely and it didn't work. I felt betrayed that I was made out to be the villain when in reality I was trying to help the team be more efficient.

AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for how I reacted to a birthday present,"Pretty sure this is on me, but anyway

  


So I (32M) got given my birthday presents this morning by my wife (32F), straight after breakfast. We've been together for 5 years, and without fail, she always mentions that I'm really hard to buy for. So in the run up to this year, she's mentioned that she had to search around to get my present, as it was out of stock on Amazon

So I'm opening the present this morning, and she mentions that it's something she could share, which in hindsight makes this hilarious, just as I see a label saying ""20 different speeds"". At this point I figured it's some kind of massager, since we both tend to complain of sore backs. I cant tell you what my face was as I'm faced with the product name, Lovely Wand, and the realisation that my wife has bought me a vibrator. My poor, straight laced wife bought me a vibrator, and she wants to share with me.

  


My guess is, that at this stage my face has dropped significantly, since she kinda mentioned that I didn't really like it did I? So I went and explained what she bought, but tried to reassure her we could use it as a massager (it is in the instructions as primarily a massager. just a waterproof, posable, rechargeable massager). She seemed a bit down, and now she's gone to take the kids for a nap, so I'm sitting here feeling bad about how I reacted AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my son go to his desired school as punishment?,"My son’s in his final year of middle school and will be starting highschool in a few months. This year he’s been getting in a lot of trouble thanks to a new group of kids he started hanging out with. 6 times my wife & I have been called to the deans office after they were caught ditching class. We’ve received complaints from his teachers that he’s being disruptive in class even after being separated from his friends. 

And now his grades are slipping too. My wife and I have worked closely with him & his teachers to make sure he doesn’t flunk. 
We’ve talked to him many times, and have grounded him from doing any activities.

I’ve been strict with him and enforcing his home punishments (no TV, no phone, no laptop unless it’s for hw), but sometimes my wife lets him get a few hours of tv before I get home from work and tries to cover for him, which we’ve also talked about but she thinks I’m being too hard on him. 

A month before school shutdown, my son asked me to put his grounding on hold because his group of friends were gonna go stay a few hours at a friends house. I said no, he threw a little temper tantrum and stayed mad at me.

When the day came, I reminded my son he’s to go straight home. I was actually feeling pretty sad that day over all the fighting and I wanted us to do something together to remind him I still love him.

 I left work early and got home around the time he should already be there and the house was empty. 

I called every parent but none of them knew which friends house they were at and my son’s phone was turned off. So my wife and I went driving around looking for him. 3 hours of worrying later, my son finally calls. The hangout was over and now he was ready to face whatever wrath awaited him. 

To say I was furious was an understatement and I let him have it soon as we got home. Since every punishment so far didnt seem to be working, I decided the only thing left is to take away his choice of school. 

Beginning of the year, he begged me to let him go to the local HS because it’s where most of his class (and friends) will be transferring too. It’s also where my wife went to school so she wanted the family tradition to continue. I agreed to it but now it didn’t seem like a good idea. So I told him he won’t be going there at all. 

My son lost it and begged me to change my mind, even my wife came to his defense but I still said no. He’s barely talked to me since then and my wife keeps arguing that I’m being unfair to him. That he’s just a boy doing teenage boy stuff. I don’t think I am and that’s not the son I want to raise. He needs to know there are consequences for his actions and if keeping him away from a group of friends that are clearly being a bad influence on him will stop him from getting into trouble, then sending him to a different school is the best option. She’s started giving me the silent treatment too and now I don’t know if maybe I am being too harsh. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for complaining after my (32f) husband (35m) called me an incompetent.,"As a little bit of background my husband had a motorcycle accident 3 months ago and his right foot had several fractures, he's doing ok now but it still hurts a lot when he needs to go down the stairs or needs to do strength related things. After the accident one of his friends took the motorcycle home and has been here since, given the stay at home order and the pain on his leg he hasn't been able to move the motorcycle at all. So I (I have no idea hot to ride a motorcycle) have been turning it on for a couple minutes every now and then (after he asked me to do it and explained the basics to me).

Last week I went to turn the thing on and it was completely dead, I have no idea how any of that works but I've seen him turn it on with a lever thingy on the side so I asked him to come downstairs with me and try it. He gave it a go but the pain was too much so he told me to do it, and as you may expect I was pretty unsuccessful.

Today during breakfast he said we would need a mechanic to check on the bike to know if it has any problems given it has been in the house for so long or if I was just incompetent. I asked him to elaborate and he said ""I need to know if there's any damage to the ignition or if is just your incompetence that won't let it turn on"". 

I told him that word was kinda harsh and that he could probably say that in better terms, he is telling me he just used the correct word for not having the ability  to do something and that is not his fault I'm deciding to take the word as offensive and he's not responsible for the way I take his ""context-appropriate"" words.

The conversation just died then and we are not talking right now, I'm kind of expecting an apology from him but he says I'm making a bigger deal than it really is and that it should be me who has to apologize for ruining the mood, and now I'm wondering if I'm just being too sensitive about it, so AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to sleep with so MANY cushions on the bed?,"My (34M) girlfriend (26F) has a LOT of pillows. She likes to put least 10-15 on our bed at all times and still buys more. Which is fine most of the time, it looks pretty nice and makes our bedroom cosy.

So many pillows, however, means that it's really hard to sleep. I've tried moving the pillows to our guest bedroom and she just moves them all back. I've tried asking her if we can get rid of some pillows but she says that 'I can just move them on the floor when I sleep and put them all back in the morning'.

I don't want to do this every single morning. It's a bit of a pain to put them all on the floor before I sleep and pick them up again in the morning.

I finally snapped the other day and told my girlfriend that I can't live this pillow life any longer. I've moved all of our pillows but three to the guest room and that's where they're going to stay.

She got really upset and started crying. She told me that I'm a dick and if I was willing to put in the effort to pick up the pillows in the morning, this wouldn't be a problem. She also said that it wasn't her fault I wasn't interested in making our house look nice.

AITA for being sick of sleeping on a million cushions every. single. night?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for fighting my brother for feeding me pork meatballs (I'm Muslim),"So my brother and his partner came over for Eid and must've not known what to bring. They ended up bringing some leftover potatoes and meatballs. 
For some reason when they reheated the food in the oven, they left the meatballs in our fridge which I thought nothing of at the time but now leads me to believe they realised and thought they could just sneakily take the meatballs out.
It was my first week back at work and I hadn't prepped food to take so I took the meatballs because I didn't want them to go to waste.
I thought the colour looked funny and that they tasted different to what I was used to but figured since my brother's partner made them that maybe it was just a different recipe than I was used to. 
I couldn't tell from the colour if they were chicken or beef so I messaged them to ask and only then did they tell me they were pork. They've been in my fridge for 2 days and my whole family are Muslim. 
When I told them that's not chill and asked why they didn't say anything my brother replied saying ""my bad I forgot"" and his partner said ""they were delicious tho lol""...
I said ""thanks for bringing them for Eid wow 👍"" and they told me to ""piss off"" and that I was being a sook.
My brothers partner left the chat and my brother said there was ""no need for that attitude wow"".
Instead of arguing about the lack of respect for my boundaries and beliefs (they are not Muslim) I just followed suit and also left the chat. 

For the record, when I visit them and they eat pork or pork products I never judge or comment, I just don't eat them...each to their own. I truly don't care what other people eat, I'm not here to pass judgement when I know damn well I'm not perfect and that every single person is entitled to their beliefs. I just feel so thrown off because I've NEVER consumed pork before in my life (the closest I came was eating cheese and bacon balls when I was a kid and when my mum kindly explained to me what bacon was, my 7 year old dramatic ass damn near collapsed and turned myself in). 

I just think it's a dick move to feed your Muslim family pork (on Eid, no less) and not even apologise for it. I feel like my brother gave a really half-hearted apology after he realised I was pissed and it came from a defensive place, not a sincere or sympathetic one. 

Am I the asshole??????

EDIT: 
So some common questions to clarify...
- Yes, my brother 100% knew it was Eid and we were both brought up culturally Muslim (never strict). I've just been enjoying and appreciating my faith more in adulthood. He's never related to it and that's fine because every. single. person is entitled to their beliefs.
- No, I don't think they did it to deceive the rest of us. I guess when something isn't on your radar from day to day, you don't notice as much i.e. they eat pork so it might not have crossed their minds when they brought it. But am I wrong to think as 2 grown ass adults, they'd at least apologise instead of saying ""my bad lol""...
- I'm aware that I'm not religiously at fault here because I ate it without knowing. I'm not a perfect Muslim but this much I do know guys. Thanks for opting for religious comfort though
- Lastly, I'm gonna disclaim that I was a bit passive aggressive in this scenario and that's kinda a dick move on my part too.

Further question guys: should I be the one to reach out and apologise? They are straight up not speaking with me now because they said I'm a dramatic sook... is it SO outrageous that I just wanted a genuine apology?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for ‘stealing’ my sisters cat?,"My family has four cats one for each family member, two of them are typical cute cats, the kind that look beautiful in every picture (one of them is even a kitten) these two belong to my parents. The other two cats are less photogenic, mine is slightly deformed and a bit weird and the other is a classic fat ginger and white, which is my sisters.

My sister does not give her cat any attention unless told to. She only gives attention to the two photogenic cats, and she calls them hers but they just aren’t, she also gets jealous if they give attention to anyone else.

So I started to give her cat attention (as well as giving my own cat attention, as he spend 90% of his time with me) and now her cat and me are like best friends. He also spends all his time with me, and never goes near my sister. She accuses me of stealing him, that wasn’t really my intention I just saw an old lonely cat who needed hugs.

Am I the asshole?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for cutting my son’s hair?,"I’ll do my best to keep this short. I have 3 boys with my wife ages 10, 8, and 7. The middle one is the son in question. Let’s call him Austin. I’m no barber but I know how to cut hair. I cut their and my hair if it gets too long. Last year my son started wanting to skip haircuts and my wife said we should let him grow it out if he wants to. I was reluctant because I care about our family looking neat and presentable. I budged in the end.

Austin’s hair got way longer than I ever would agree to. It is past his shoulders. His brothers tease him for looking like a girl and I wouldn’t be surprised if he got that at school too. I asked my son if he would like to cut his hair. He said no but he’s a child. I talked to my wife over and over about it who insisted that he be allowed to decide for himself. I disagree because I think he’s too young to know what is appropriate or not. I wouldn’t allow one of my kids to wear his swim shorts to school. You have to teach kids by saying no sometimes. When she was at work today I decided to cut Austin’s hair and apologize to my wife for it later. He looks way better. He didn’t want the haircut at first but now says he likes it. 

When my wife got a look at him and heard that I made him cut his hair, I swear steam came out of her ears. I have never seen her so angry. She told me I was a bad father today and refuses to even talk to me. While we were arguing she said she had half a mind to leave me over this. I think she is making a really big deal out of hair that my son does not even miss. I knew she would be angry but this seems like blowing it way out of proportion. Hair grows back. Anyways, AITA here?

Update - Mixed comments but I’ll accept the majority saying I’m in the wrong. Austin talked to my wife this morning and apparently said he misses his long hair. My wife is even more furious if that’s possible. I hope he gets used to it but I may let him grow it out again if he wants to. Thanks"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for lying to my grandma about what I'm feeding her?,"My grandmother (86f) has been asking me to make this specific curry for the past 2 weeks or so.

To make it you need breadfruit, which I could not find anywhere. I've driven around the town trying to find it, but no dice. Instead I've been making the curry using potato. The first few times she asked what's in it, I told her truthfully that it was potato. She looked so sad, and even cried a little. She refused to eat anything those nights. Now when grandma asks what's in it, I reply ""it's breadfruit"". Her face absolutely lights up. She used to have this breadfruit curry as a child, but now can't really tell the difference between it and potato. She's in her 80s, I honestly think she has good memories of eating said food, but can't really remember its taste.

She's going back to a nursing home in a few weeks, and I know that ""breadfruit curry"" will not be a menu option. I'm still running around trying to find actual breadfruit, but until then potato it is.

She's been consistently asking for this for dinner every night, and refuses when I offer to make her something else.

My family found out what I was doing and is kind of split. My sister thinks I'm being incredibly deceptive and should stop lying to her, while my cousin thinks that I'm just making grandma happy before she goes to her nursing home.

Edit: Thanks for sending me links to get breadfruit, but it's really expensive online where I live and I can't stomach spending that much money on just one item. So for now I'll just stick to trying to get it in store, or find tinned ones.  Thanks!"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for supporting my cousins ex-husband over her?,"Context: My cousin, let's call her Star, cheated on her now ex-husband, let's call him Bear, with a co-worker of hers a couple years ago. Previously, she visited our grandparents and aunt to introduce them to her husband at that time, Bear. When Bear left the room, Star started insulting him saying he wasn't the brightest or smartest person which pissed off my family because well..that was her husband. Fast forward after the divorce, he lives with my aunt and uncle to take care of their 2 year old baby, lets call her Sunny, while she's off with her new boy. Custody is split and they alternate times to see Sunny. One week, while at my cousins, Sunny broke her arm. I mean, BROKE her arm. From falling off a couch. And brushed it aside while we and everyone else were going ""How the fuck did you manage to let a 2 year old break her fucking arm??"" But I digress. My uncle and aunt began to favor Bear and Sunny over Star which seemed to invoke rage because one day while at the Hospital (My uncle injured himself after crashing his car) she was pissed they chose Bear over her. She blocked the family and wants nothing to do with everyone. 

Fast forward to November of 2019. Bear has a new woman in his life, let's call her Moon. Moon is an absolutely wonderful woman and a pleasant mother figure to Sunny. My uncle and aunt love her and she seems to love everybody and especially Sunny.  They are engaged. My grandmother throws a ever-loving fit about how this will be damaging to Sunny that Star and Bear are split and seeing other people. She wants them to stay together or at the very least wants Bear to not re-marry so Sunny can have a ""un-normal normal"" life between her two parents. I lost my shit. Star cheated on Bear, a man who loved her to bits and would have struck down any man who harmed her. Just by his gaze you could see how much of a fool he was, being so in love with my cousin. I told her I'd rather she have Bear and Moon as her parents than Bear by himself and Star remarry and fuck whoever else she'd like to. I don't support Star and I hope she apologizes not only to Bear but their daughter Sunny when she's able to understand the situation. My grandmother told me I was wrong for choosing someone outside of the family over Star, especially with my circumstances as to why I'm in the family.   
Am I the asshole for choosing Bear and his happiness over my irresponsible and negligent cousin Star?   

Sorry if this makes no sense, I'll try to edit it if I need to."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for trying to rehome my girlfriend’s kittens?,"My girlfriend has a big soft spot for animals, but she has a HUGE one for cats. I personally don’t mind them but I’m more of a dog person. Every morning my gf goes for a jog and she’s noticed a stray cat that roamed kind of close to our house. My gf, being who she is, would bring her food and water but the cat was too skittish to be caught though she would eat the food my gf gave her. She also noticed that the cat was likely pregnant because it seemed like she’d get more round in the belly. Eventually, she gave birth because she was gone for a few days and when she showed back up she wasn’t as round anymore. One day, gf went on her jog and she found the cat dead on the side of the street. She moved the cat in a close by wooded area where she heard small meows. She eventually found where they were coming from and it was a litter of 3 kittens.  They were about the right age for them to be the dead cats babies. She said she couldn’t leave them there to starve or be eaten so she caught them and brought them home and she’s been taking care of them ever since. They’re about 3 months old now. I feel like my gf spends more time with these cats than with me now. If she’s not working, she’s in the “cat room”. On several occasions she’s fallen asleep on the floor with them. Yes, she still cooks, and cleans but it seems her world has orbited around this litter. They’re cute and all but I’m tired of them being here and I’m over that they get most of her attention. I think the only reason why she wants them is because of a “traumatic” experience from when she was a kid. I’ve been looking for people who might want them and I think I found a good home. This mother and daughter in the neighborhood who I’m familiar with were interested in them. I sent the mother pictures of the kittens and after a little back and forth she agreed to take them. Her and her daughter (~12) came over to see them in person and to take them home. As I’m getting them ready to go my gf comes home and she sees what’s happening. She immediately starts freaking out asking what I’m doing and who are these people. I tell her who they are and they’re here for the kittens. My gf completely lost it. She starts crying and screaming at me to put them down and they’re not going anywhere. She started  scaring our neighbors and I keep trying to calm her down but at that point she’s hyperventilating and crying. She grabs the carrier with the kittens and runs out of the house and drives off. The neighbors basically just left without saying much else. I honestly don’t know what the big deal is? I mean they’re just cats, and I didn’t even really want them to begin with. She won’t answer my calls or texts and I’m getting tired of her being so dramatic about this. AITA?

Edit: I’m having a hard time keeping up. For those commenting about why I said ‘“trauma”’, I put “trauma” in quotes because I don’t think it was THAT bad. And no I’m not allergic or anything, I do sometimes hang out with her and the kittens but I find them kind of... boring and annoying so I lose interest and do something different. Like at least if it was a puppy I/we could train it to do cool tricks and stuff. But they just want to play with strings and feathers and stuff."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not paying for something that broke when I was babysitting?,"~ this happened before lockdown, but it's still being argued about~ 

My (16F) aunt and uncle came over for dinner, and asked me to babysit their kids (4 year old twins). I refused, I don't have any experience with babysitting and wouldn't know what to do. They kinda pushed me into it, since 'they babysat me when I was a kid, so it's nice to give back' so after talked a bit more I agreed. 

They needed me from 10:00 to 22:00, so babysitting included making lunch/snacks/dinner/bathtime/putting them to bed. I was pretty nervous, and told them that, but they insisted I do it. 

So most of the day went okay. The problem came when I was cooking dinner. I put them in front of the tv with a movie on, but one of them started wandering around and threw my uncle's smartphone (I don't know where he got it, my uncle thinks he left it inbetween the couch cushions) in the toilet. I fished it out and put it in a bag of uncooked rice. 

My uncle thinks it's his fault and isn't mad, but my aunt is. She's insisting I pay for the phone (900 euros or so). My mom thinks I shouldn't have to pay, my dad thinks I should offer to pay half. It's been an argument for a while now. 

I personally don't think I should pay, I don't know how they expect me to watch two toddlers while cooking dinner knowing I never ever babysat before. Plus leaving an almost thousand euro phone laying around when they aren't home. 

AITA for not wanting to pay?

Edit: since some people keep asking: I wasn't paid to babysit."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for blowing up at my parents after I suspected they were gaslighting me?,"So I (15M) have been looking for my AirPods for about a week now. My parents have been getting mad at me for losing them and have threatened to take away my PC if I didn't find them. Today, I was looking for them again for a few hours and I checked my parents' room, where they were stashed in my parents' drawer. I confronted them each separately and they both claimed it was the other parent moving it there because they thought it was just a case and not the actual AirPods. I proceeded to get angry and harshly accuse my mom of doing it, to which she yelled back, ""You should just be happy you found them."" Am I the asshole for yelling at her?"
AmItheAsshole,"AITA for telling my fiance's brother that ""there are personality traits other than dickhead and edgelord""?","Backstory on my boyfriend's brother is that I don't like him and he doesn't like me. My family is comfortable without being wealthy while my boyfriend's family is definitely wealthy, and the brother seems to think I'm a golddigger despite my boyfriend and I splitting everything 50/50. He is the kind of person who will ask the groom on the day of his wedding if he needs a getaway driver and tell people to get prenups at their engagement party, and I'm saying this because I've seen him do both things more than once.


I'm pregnant. It's definitely ahead of schedule but my fiancé and I are happy about it. I'm around 5 months pregnant, my fiance proposed about 2 weeks before we found out. We told his family earlier today over zoom. His mum, dad, and sister congratulated us and his brother did too, but then the brother made a joke about getting a prenup (which we are doing anyway). My fiance's sister told him to shut the fuck up and the dad said ""come on now"" in a reproachful tone, and then I said ""just checking are you aware there are personality traits other than dickhead and edgelord?"", after which my fiance's mother told me off for speaking to her son like that because he's just looking out for his brother. I asked if ""I'm just meant to let him say whatever he wants, then?""

Call ended quickly after that, and now I've had messages from my future parents in law and brother in law all expecting me to apologize in order to smooth things over. Fiance says not to apologise for shit and his sister says they're ridiculous but this might be the easiest way to move on, and pointed out that I did go for him there when they'd already spoken to him.

Aita?"
AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to walk the dogs with my family, because I hate “poop tag”?","I (25F) have been staying at home with my family for the last two months. My family wanted me to spend quarantine with them, so I have been working from my parents house since.

My mom and dad (50s), sister (12), and I have been going on daily evening walks with our two dogs - one is mine and the other our family dog. This is usually a great and enjoyable time for our family. For the last week, my dad and sister really got into a game called “Poop Tag”, it’s basically where after the dogs poop and the bag is tied they throw the dog poop bag at each other and my mom and I. 

I hate this game. I don’t like getting poop, even if it’s in a bag, thrown at me and I don’t find it funny. I told them multiple times I would not walk with them if this continued. I think they thought I was joking, because they would not stop AND added new components to this game - wave poop above my head, pretend to hit me with it with large swings.

Two days ago I refused to go on walks with them anymore and now just walk my dog alone. They’ve since apologized to me and my mom for this game and have asked me to rejoin our family walks.  I do miss our family walks and probably want to rejoin, but am still really mad about the poop tag. I want to wait it out for a couple more days to get over this. Am I being unreasonable here?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for mentally giving up on a kid?,"Okay so I am a behavioral therapist for autistic kids. And with COVID and everything going on, sessions have been moved around but haven’t stopped. I have this one kid who we will call John. John is 8 years old and very aggressive. My job with John is to help him understand simple things better like time, patience, social cues, etc. This kid had promise when I started, which was about a month before the pandemic. But as the pandemic continue, his behavior has gotten worse. Session is about 3 1/2 hours. The moment I knock on the door I can hear “I DONT WANT TO DO SESSION!” Now, why doesn’t he want to do session? Because he wants to play roblox and fortnite. That’s all he wants to do. Watch YouTube videos about those games and to play them. It takes about 30-45 minutes to get him to calm down because he doesn’t want therapy. He wants to play roblox and fortnite on his xbox. And when we take it away, he will call his mom a bitch. 

Now his poor mother, I feel so bad for her. She just wants what’s best for her kid but all he does is abuse her. She tells me that it’s okay because he doesn’t understand but I can see it’s slowly killing her. She doesn’t sleep at all because every 30 minutes or so, the kid will wake her up in the middle of the night for whatever reasons. 

Going through this with the kid every single session has started to get to me. I try my absolute best with all my kids, even my non verbals. I want to help them and make sure they are learning, but this kid. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m still doing therapy with him and I will still do what I normally do and try to help him the best I can but deep deep down I have given up on him. I feel guilty for feeling like this. So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: to the people saying that I should drop him, I don’t pick my kids and the parents don’t get to pick the therapists, so if I were to say that I can’t help him to my company, they would have to find a replacement for him and if they couldn’t, I would have to keep him. With COVID going on right now, there is an extreme shortage in my area of therapists due to them choosing not to work. Every therapist in my company at the moment has about 5-7 kids and are working almost 12 hours a day.

Edit 2: if you guys actually read the post, I’ve only mentally given up. I still try and do my normal stuff with him like I’ve always done. The exact way my company wants me to. I’ve gotten in trouble for trying to mix things up and do different things than my company has given me. Everything I can do for him is only allowed by the insurance company, if I do anything else, I can get fired.

Edit 3: I don’t think I explained this well enough, his behavior has gotten worse since the lockdown. I have been the only non family member they have seen since the lockdown. I truly believe that this has worsened him and maybe once things start going up, he might get better, but I don’t know. 

Final Edit: after some thought and after reading everyone from YTA to NAH, I’ve decided to get professional help for myself to I can better help my kids. Thank you all."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a girl my ex likes what happened during our relationship?,"This is something I’ve struggled with for a while as it happened over a year ago and I’m not sure if what I did was justified. Using an alt account for obvious reasons. I’m also not sure if this will get removed. 

I was dating this guy for just over a year in high school. Long story short for most of our relationship he did some pretty bad things to me that I hid from friends and family. I lost 20 pounds due to stress and anxiety from this relationship. 

After we were broken up I had talked to him about it to see if he realized what he had done to me. He said he did and he was sorry it happened and then begged me not to tell anyone. I had no intention of letting people know about it, just people I was close with. 

I’m trying to keep this brief but there is a lot I’m leaving out. 

One day in college I was catching up with a girl me and ex knew in high school. She asked about him and what happened and I hesitated but explained it to her. She wasn’t surprised. Apparently there was an incident during the summer before college with ex and one of her friends. I was angry he didn’t take our conversations seriously when I asked him to stop his behavior. 

There was a girl that ex had been very close to at his church for several years. (Different girl than the incident) They had always been flirting and I knew while ex and I were together that she had feelings for him. I admittedly didn’t care for her because it was evident he liked her too. My ex had expressed after breaking up that he intended on dating her when she went to college (she is a year younger than us). In this moment my heart broke for her. After all I had went through and knowing what it did to me I called this girl. I FaceTimed her and told her almost everything (leaving out most of the gory details). She sobbed and thanked me for telling her. I felt sick after it but felt like I did what I needed to. 

A few days after I got an angry text from ex saying why did I get this girl involved and it wasn’t my place to tell her. Apparently she had told her parents who were prominent in their church. Ex said he would have told her in his own time but I don’t think I believe him. She even told him that she would have preferred to hear it from him even though I had a text from her stating she was glad I told her. 

Was I TA for telling this girl? I just wanted to warn her but I think I may have overstepped especially since we were never close and I actually never really liked her but felt I needed to tell her."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to be a host to my mom's guests?,"Despite social distancing guide lines, my mom seems to want to invite a new person over every other day. Not only that she tends to have a bad habit of asking me to take on much of the hosting responsabilities like cooking, catering, and entertaining. 

Today mom invited some of her friends and their gaggle of kids to play in the pool. She was doing most of the catering this time which was nice sense I wasn't interested in being there. this was partially because I was tired from all these social gatherings but also because I'm trying to do my own things in my room. 

They all went to the backyard so I went to my room and started setting up my art project. Minutes later mom starts calling my name. I go to see what's wrong. It turns out she's tired. She wants me to come downstairs so she can take a nap in her room. I *really* didn't want to hang out with them.

She said, *""Oh come on. you can just stay here in the living room. It's just in case they need anything. You can even bring you art stuff down here.""*

Here's the kicker: We have a macaw who is bonded to me. When other people are around she's relatively quiet but if I'm there she flips out and tries her darndest to get me to pick her up. I have ADHD. I *cannot* consentrate on my work when she's clinging to me. I just can't. I need piece and quiet.

I put my foot down and told mom that I did not want to be downstairs right now. She got really annoyed but didn't fight it any further. Moments later I heard her tell her friends that she was going to sleep on the couch instead.

Now I feel bad that I refused to help. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for keeping the shoes?,"My friend had these really, really dirty (and old ish?) Nikes that she told me she was gonna get rid of, because “cleaning them is impossible and too much work”. 

They were not too bad off, just dirty and even in my size! So me being a broke university student asked if I could have them, and she said yes, do what you want with them. I normally save all of my money, so no new shoes in a while, boy was I happy!

She gave me the shoes some days before the lockdown, so we haven’t seen eachother in about two months before this past saturday. 

I had cleaned the shoes really intense, and actually used many hours and money on it. We had a little get together with some of our friends (yes, my country is NOT in lockdown anymore, it is very controlled). 

At this get together she saw the shoes, and said “oh Thank you *my name*, you fixed up my shoes!”. At this point i thought she was joking, and said something like “yeah, they just needed a little love to shine perfectly white and bright again”. 

She then started asking why I had them on, and if I could take HER shoes off - at this point i was like ????, and told her she gave them to me, so i would not take them off. 

Most friends are on my side and are saying that because she would have dumped them in the trash and GAVE them to me, they are mine. I sure as hell think they belong to me too, because 1) she gave them to me, and 2) I spend a lot of money and time to fix them and 3) SHE GAVE THEM TO ME. 

She is accusing me of stealing them and that i was only “borrowing them”. She left quikly, and some of the others said i was kinda an asshole for not giving them back. 

AITA?

Edit: okay, it might be important, but she called my parents and told them a sob story about how i took them from her. They now know the true story, but are saying i should give them back to “maintain peace” - they are saying I am being a bad friend for keeping them. I really don’t want to give them back, OR maintain that relationship."
AmItheAsshole,WIBTA for telling my In-laws to step up as parents?,"My SO’s mom remarried. MIL and SFIL adopted a daughter (LS, now 12) when she was just a baby. However, both MIL and SFIL are very distant parents. LS isn’t neglected, all of her basic needs are met. But that’s the extent of it.

LS is a nightmare. I refused to keep babysitting about a year ago because LS would throw full on, screaming, pounding on the floor, tantrums when I’d ask her to clean up. LS refuses to drink anything that isn’t soda or coffee, and MIL and SFIL see no problem with it. LS has even been told by doctors that she needs to eat and drink better, and my MIL just says “LS doesn’t want too” or “LS doesn’t like that stuff”. 

On top of the tantrums, she’ll take things right out of your hand. And if you say anything, it’s a meltdown. She’s CONSTANTLY plugged in. If she’s not on the computer, she’s on her IPad, which she plays at full volume, and if you ask her to turn it down, you guessed it; meltdown. She has had no supervision online, and knew what sex and drugs were at 7 and has bragged about this knowledge multiple times over the years. 

LS also adds everyone on social media, especially ones that allow you to track and see exactly where your “friends” are. I’ve brought this up to my in-laws, they see nothing wrong. LS also post videos on SM of her at home and says things like “everyone come over” which is then sent to every stranger on her friends list.

Her behavior just keeps getting worse and worse, but my in-laws won’t do anything. Her tantrums are getting longer and louder, and her behaviors are worsening too. She throws things and screams, she has even started talking to the air as if it is her “viewers” and won’t engage in normal conversation. She’ll talk to the air behind you, like a camera is there, not you. 

The last straw was this last week. LS was at a friends house and was making prank calls. Somehow, she had my number (note, LS does not have a cell phone of her own) and called me. Another note, I’ve been stalked by men multiple times, so I don’t give out my number and I don’t let anyone give my number out. Getting weird messages and phone calls from an unknown number unsettled me. So I asked MIL, who was over, if she knew the #. MIL recognized the # as LS’s friend’s mom’s #. I told MIL she should discipline LS. MIL waved it off. I was raised in a pretty strict household, and something like harassing calls and messages would have gotten me picked up from where I was & taken home &punished. I understand that prank calls are harmless, but LS has been told not to give out my number before (or anyone’s number because of a similar situation).

WIBTA for talking to my inlaws about stepping up as parents? They adopted her, so it’s not like they didn’t want her. But neither one acts like a parent. I’m really worried for LS’s  future but I’m also not a parent and LS isn’t my child, so I don’t know if I’d be an AH for saying something more than what I have."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for walking out of a job interview?,"Around this time last year, I was in the job hunt and was looking at tech sales positions in my area. I’d been in this career about ten years, and had been recently laid off.

I was granted an interview at a relatively large startup downtown, and after the initial phone screen, I did my research and went on site for my in-person interview.

Admittedly, I got there about 25 minutes early, which was pushing obnoxious, but nobody was at the front desk. So I signed in using the iPad, took a seat, and waited. I waited until the time of the interview, got up, looked around, and started trying to get the attention of people walking around, as nobody had acknowledged me to this point.

At 15 minutes past the interview scheduled time, a lady came into the lobby and asked what I was there for. I let her know I had an interview scheduled for 15 minutes ago. She asked me to hold on and went back into the office, and a few minutes later, came back with an agenda with materials laid out about the company. The agenda confirmed that were were supposed to have already started, and that I had two interviewers in the next two 30-minute blocks.

A new person came over and sat me in a room and told me to read over the materials to get familiar. I did this for 45 minutes, and when the VP of sales didn’t show up to interview me, I got pissed, stood up, and left. I found my way to the front desk and told the person who was not there before and had likely no idea who I was that I was ending my interview, and to have a great day.

About 15 minutes later, I got a frantic call from the recruiter saying the VP was looking for me and that they wanted to start my interview. I answered that if they weren’t willing to respect my time, then I knew all I needed to know about what working there would be like.

I told several folks this story, and it’s been a 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing, or that I don’t know the circumstances and that I could have stuck around and at least interviewed and let them know later on. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA here? Quit my job and told them why,"So last week I quit my job (I got an amazing offer from an amazing company). 

My almost-former boss asked why and I told her (via email due to COVID) the complete truth: microagressions, lack of diversity (or interest in bring more in), nepotism, exclusion and subtle racism, homophobia, and sexism. I copied her bosses and sent a diversity plan to them. 

I listed examples and pasted links for how to deal with and recognize microagressions. I listed out examples of what I’ve experienced and made suggestions on how they can correct it.

This was last Friday - on my day off. They have yet to reply.

Edit: note - I’m in HR and I manage the AAP, hiring, and diversity for this company. - it’s literally my job."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my fiancé to choose between drinking and our family?,"Long story short, my fiancé has always been a drinker. He has a drink every night to wind down after working swing shift while he plays video games. His drink consists of a 20oz Yeti cup filled with ice. Then filled 2/3 with Jim Beam followed by Dr. Pepper. He’d typically just have the one drink about 11pm when he got home and come to bed about 2am. 

Over the last year, his drinking has gotten crazy. He now drinks 3 of those cups a night, every single night. He stays up past 4am getting wasted while playing his game and yelling the whole time. I get up for work at 5:30 am so it’s very disturbing to sleep in our bed. Many nights I sleep on the couch. After playing and drinking, he goes and wrecks my kitchen heating up food. I used to make allowances because he was still able to get up for work and he’d let me sleep in one weekend day and take care of the kids that morning. And I don’t think I really realized how much he was drinking. 

But now we’re both home, his drinking really bothers me. As I watch him fill his cup with liquor I feel repulsed. Because I know that the more he drinks, the more obnoxious and verbally abusive he becomes. Every night I’m called a bitch or a whore. And if I say anything, he says he can’t joke with me. But I don’t find it funny nor do I see how it’s a joke when I’m literally just laying there trying to sleep.

The other night I snapped. My stove was covered in queso. He had kept me up all night with his yelling and all the kitchen noise. I told him it’s us or alcohol. Previous talks asking him to slow down his drinking only made him drink more so I’m at my wits end.

His response was to say he will drink more now and maybe if I got drunk, he’d like me better. So I walked away. And I haven’t spoken to him since unless absolutely necessary. I know alcoholism is a disease and it runs in his family. I’m conflicted with wanting to be happy and feeling guilty for the ultimatum. So AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for eating ice cream in front of my lactose intolerant brother?,"My 16 year old brother was diagnosed with lactose intolerance about 8 months ago, he has it fairly bad I think he can’t eat anything with lactose in it without having to leave in the bathroom for like 2 days afterward.

My mum has bought lactose free and vegan food to accommodate him while trying to not majorly change his diet. One sore spot for him is ice cream, he has vegan friendly ice cream in our freezer but claims it doesn’t taste the same. I’ve got no clue, I don’t eat it because I don’t want to limit the amount of food he can eat in the house.

So because of the recent hot weather where I live mums been getting more ice cream when she does the shopping. She buys a tub for each of us so there isn’t an issue with sharing ( she’s always done this I think it comes from being 1 of 8 kids growing up and sharing being difficult). 

It was the afternoon and the temperature was at its peak so without really thinking about it I went and got my ice cream out and was sat on the sofa eating it, my brother comes down sees me and almost immediately starts shouting while demanding to know what I’m eating. I told him it was cookie dough ice cream and he wanted to know if it was suitable for him, I responded no because it wasn’t and he had a tube of chocolate in the freezer that he could eat.

He started shouting about how he is always left out and disrespected for being different, that he’s always bought shit ice cream and that if he has to make do with vegan ice cream everyone else should too, he then stormed up the stairs and slammed his bedroom door as hard as he could. 

Mum and dad have opted to ignore it, they’re putting it down to a stress reaction, he’s asked me to apologise to him because he feels I was inconsiderate of his issues. I don’t think I need to apologise, he’s been offered pills that could help him eat lactose foods but refused them and he has got food options. Why do I have to change my diet for him or my eating habits for him?

So AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to pay the full car payment and removing my dad’s access from my bank account?,"Background: 
My brother (20M) and I (23F)share a car. Sucks but he invested in it ($700 worth from one car traded in for a few thousand to get current car) and my dad got the lease under his own name. 

We’ve been making payments of $250 for 3 years and are about 11 months from paying it off. 

I was upset that I didn’t have a car while in college and now had to share one. I would’ve been able to save for my own if allowed to work in high school but I wasn’t allowed where my brother was. It’s whatever I’m not gonna complain about having a car 50% of the time. 

I have always made every payment on time to my dad. He has access to my account so he’d just take $250 for the car payment and my insurance each month. 

My brother his freshman year of college was so irresponsible and refused to work his work study job or search for another campus job. He then proceeded to refuse to eat dining hall food and leech off me guilting next starting at 8pm when the dining halls closed to not only get him food but pick it up for him and drop it off most days. 

During this time he was broke constantly and didn’t pay my dad a car payment for the entire school year. 

**current**

My brother and I now switch off weeks with the car since we don’t live together. When I have the car, my boyfriend drives it too but he’s usually either with me doing something together or running errands with me I could’ve done alone. There have been very few times he’s used the car for his own reasons. 

My brother doesn’t have a job. 
I just landed a salaried position. 
My boyfriend is working on getting a job. 

My dad (since my boyfriend has used the car) is now insisting that my boyfriend and I pay the entire payment. The full $500 since my dad “has been so cool with bf using it.” I know my dad has been pulling this shit because he is running low on funds too. 

WIBTA if I refused to pay this full amount?

I currently am waiting to start getting paid and until then have $30 to my name? I am hoping to get my stimulus check in the mail soon as well. So I plan on removing my dad from my account so he can’t just go in and take the money.

TLDR: just got a new job, brother doesn’t have one. Brother And I share the car. My boyfriend periodically uses my car. Because of this my dad wants me to pay the full car payment. I want to remove my dad from my checking account when I start getting paid to prevent this."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for canceling my girlfriend's Blue Apron subscription?,"So my girlfriend and I have been living together for a few months now, and in that time she has become really reliant on her Blue Apron subscription for most of our meals. I have told her multiple times that I don't like the food - it's not my style and I would prefer not to eat it, but I've forced myself several times to be polite. She's basically told me that it's not my choice what she chooses to eat, but she neglects to realize that even though it's her home, we're both living there now and sacrifices need to be made on both ends. I put up with her disgusting box of food for a few weeks, but I reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore, and frankly I was off-put by her laziness and reluctance to actually cook a meal. I took it upon myself to log onto her laptop and cancel the subscription - keep in mind, this was a decision that affected both of us, and she hasn't really seemed to care much for what I want. She assumed it was a technical error for a while until I informed her what I did, which sent her into total hysterics. I'm honestly tired of hearing her complain and I'm tired of her laziness, especially in a time when she's not the only person in the house. Would you guys agree that I was at least justified to cancel the Blue Apron subscription, considering the circumstances?

**TL;DR: Canceled my girlfriend's food box subscription because she was being lazy about cooking and I don't like the meals, she hasn't been accommodating to me at all about it.**"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my MIL I will never have children?,"This one is pretty straightforward. My husband and I have been married for two years. Ever since our wedding night, my MIL has been talking about grandchildren. Nonstop. I understand she’s excited. It’s a thing mother in laws do. Whatever. Up until December, I would just shrug it off. I wasn’t ready for a baby and neither was my husband. We were happy building our careers, and - sure - having a baby was a definite long-term plan of ours, but we just weren’t ready. Not yet.

Well, in December, I found out I can’t have children. My husband and I were pretty crushed. After that, my MIL’s small remarks about “grand babies” made my heart sink. Around the new year, my husband and I asked her to (please.) stop asking and making comments about us having children because it made us uncomfortable. And she did! It was great. 

Then corona hit and, well, up until very recently, I hadn’t seen anyone but my husband in months. He and I have started to accept the fact that we may never have a biological child,  and we’ve even discussed adoption/other options at length. It’s been a process, but we’ve been communicating about it. It’s been really good for us. 

The first time I saw my MIL post-quarantine, last week, she immediately made a comment about how since my husband and I have spent so much time together, she’s bound to have a grand baby for the new year. Before I could even think, I snapped, “no, and you probably never will because I’m infertile.”

She looked crestfallen and was mortified. I didn’t mean to snap at her like that, but it just came out of me. Initially, my husband was super supportive and kept telling me that this was on her, and we had asked her to stop asking. Now, he wants ME to apologize, saying his mother keeps crying on the phone with him because she thinks I hate her. So... I have to apologize? I know what I did was abrupt. I own that. But, I don’t think I should apologize. 

Am I the asshole?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for threatening to kick my sister and her children out during a global pandemic?,"My (20F) sister (30F) has two kids (5F and 7M) She recently divorced her husband and is temporarily staying with me because she has nowhere else to go. She could move in with our parents but for some reason, she decided to stay with me for a few days. Few days turned into months because of the pandemic and so, here we are.

I honestly don't mind. I love her, and I love the kids. What I can't stand is her behaviour. Bear with me. This is going to sound very bizarre. 

My sister is very religious. She has a facebook group, whatsapp group and an instagram where she has about 5000 followers. She's probably also on reddit and many other social media.

Usually, she's nice and sweet, but lately, she's become somewhat crazy. She has these “sessions” with her kids every few days. These “sessions” last about half an hour. During these sessions, she teaches her kids about the LGBTQ community. Not good things, but she teaches them about how being gay is a sin and all of that. Being Transgender is a disease. How to avoid getting infected etc. She tells them to repeat words after her, and then makes a video and uploads it everywhere.

It's very very bizarre. She gets a lot of likes on social media where like-minded people praise her and upload similar videos of them having these “sessions” with their kids. She's part of this group trying to “lead the new generation to the right path” Her little daughter who is five has the sentences memorized. “Being gay is a sin. You will burn in hell” is her answer if you ask her “What do you think about gay people?”

The problem is I'm bisexual. My sister conveniently forgets that. “No, you're not. You'll get over it when you meet the right person” is what she tells me when I mention it.

This is my house. I will not tolerate her disrespecting me in my own home. I told her that as long as she stays in my home, eats my food, uses my things, she's not allowed to have these “sessions” in my living room. This led to a massive argument where she bragged about her followers, refused to listen to me, insulted me and refused to apologize. 

I ended up threatening her. I told her she can't live here if she behaves this way which made her cry. Now I'm the heartless, selfish asshole in my family who threatened to kick her poor divorced sister and her little kids out in the middle of a global pandemic. I would obviously never do that to her. I only wanted her to stop being homophobic. Besides, she can always go to our parents.

I have apologized countless times, even to my parents, but I'm being repeatedly called heartless. Am I the asshole for wanting my sister to stop being homophobic? Am I the asshole for threatening her to get her to stop?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to do free labor for family?,"Okay, so backstory... I have an aunt who has two girls (16 & 9) my aunt doesn’t know how or care to learn how to do hair. I learned how to do my own hair when I was younger, so I’m fairly good at braiding, etc. 

However, being a hairstylist is not my ambition. I actually hate doing hair, but because they had no one else to do their hair.. I did it for them, didn’t ask for anything in return. The free hairstyles went on for about 2 months.. 

When I started getting short on cash, and realized she was bringing them by my house almost every week to get their hair done.. (retwist for the older girls whole head, and the younger usually wanted some style she’d seen on Instagram) I told her that I’d like to start getting paid $20 per head. Which isn’t bad considering that the process to do both heads usually took me all day. 

She got upset and refused, started talking about all the things she’d done for me.. which only included a few rides to work (which she was compensated for) & she started taking her girls to a hair salon, paying way more than what I asked for. When I questioned the logic, she said if she was going to pay for her kids hair to be done it was going to be professionally. Okay, no problem.. I hate doing hair anyway. 

So, now that COVID has shut down most businesses.. she had my mom reach out to me asking me to do the girls hair. Again, I said I would but it will be $20 per head. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong, she has the funds.. she just doesn’t feel like she should have to pay me. My mom, and other aunts have been texting me about the value of family and being there for one another, calling me selfish, etc... but considering I’m out of work and barely making it.. I don’t think I’m the one being selfish.. thoughts? 

LSDR; Aunt doesn’t feel the need to pay me to do her kids hair, but will pay professionals for 3x my asking price!"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for misusing quarantine rules?,"This happened some weeks ago when I was working at a quarantine ward of one of the local hospitals (Freelance RN). Didn't think much of it until today. It'll become a case study before the local ethics board (I'm invited since it's about my decision, got the mail today).

As mentioned, I worked at the quarantine ward of a hospital when I got a new patient (let's call her Sally). No initial diagnosis, only some symptoms that may or may not be related to the actual pandemic. Took her in, explained everything and did my initial anamnesis. Turned out she's 17 and her parents didn't know she went to the hospital (complicated family history). Told her it's ok, but if they call and ask I'd have to tell them that she's with us. She agreed but didn't want me to tell anyone why she's in the hospital. Again, I told her that's ok and we'll respect that. 

Time went by, nobody called, all tests came back negative and the diagnosis was an endometriosis with panic attacks. Obviously, the one that really scares the shit out of you.

That day we got a call from her mom. She wanted to know why her daughter is in the hospital, why she wasn't informed about that and why her daughter doesn't really answer her phone. Seems she texted her and all that Sally wrote back was something like ""It's fine, fuck off"". Told her that Sally is my patient but that I'm not allowed to give her any info about her medical status, especially not on the phone (could be anyone calling). So she told me she'd come to the hospital. And I replied that this wouldn't be a good idea due to the whole pandemic thing and the hospital lockdowns. She insisted, so I didn't try to change her decision. Told Sally about her mom's plans and the first thing she said was that she didn't want to see her. Twice. It would have been enough that way, but hospital regulations allowed visits in extreme and/or special circumstances.

The inevitable happened: Mom arrived at the hospital, security denied entry, mom demanded to talk to the responsible Dr., they had a short discussion and then the Doc came to me because of the issue at hand: Mom wanted to see her daughter. We went both to Sally, told her about the situation and she refused to see her mom. Doc didn't really have a say when it came to visits, that was my responsibility and decision. Reminded me that this absolutely qualified for the ""special circumstances"". And I decided against the mother, respecting the repeated wishes of my patient. Went to mom, told her about the decision. 

Sally was happy, mom was raging. Seems she wrote a massive complaint (the reason for the case study). 

Tl;dr: Minor was my patient, didn't want to see her mom, I didn't let mom in using quarantine regulations.

P.S.: Before anyone tries to explain the law to me because she was a minor, please don't. I'm not in the US and I know my local laws. They were on the patients side and supported my decision"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling husband with a migraine to sleep on the couch?,"So, the husband suffers from migraines. He gets one every three or four months. But they’re pretty debilitating. The kids and I are extra quiet and leave him alone to sleep for hours or until the next day when he has one. That’s fine, I’ll hold down the fort. Usually by the time I go to bed, he will have made the room uninhabitable for me. The a/c will either be set extremely cold or heat on high and he’s wrapped himself in all the bedding. Like a cocoon. There won’t be anything left for me to use except the scratchy spare blanket. If I make any noise or turn on any lights  getting to bed or sleeping, he snaps at me. Usually by that point he goes to sleep in the living room, snapping at me that I should be the one to sleep on the couch. 
Today he had a migraine and has been out of it since noon. I’ve dealt with the kids alone, including the newborn baby. I’ve brought him food and medications and whatever else he needed. Finally I got the other kids to bed and
I was exhausted. I told him to get up and get his stuff and to sleep on the couch. He started protesting and said to just grab my own stuff to sleep on the couch...but there’s literally nowhere safe for me to put the baby to sleep. Her crib is in our room, next to my side. We don’t have a bassinet and besides, she sleeps really well in her own crib. She’s still way too young to be alone in her room and she’s breastfeeding. It doesn’t make sense for me to have to sleep on the couch away from her. 
I feel really sympathetic that he’s going through this, I know it’s really painful and knocks him out. I really do everything I can to make him more comfortable during the day and before bedtime, but AITA for telling him to sleep on the couch while he has one? 
BTW it’s a pullout couch with an upgraded mattress. It’s pretty comfortable but definitely not safe to cosleep with baby.


Edit- I’ve been asked to edit the post with this information. I apologize I thought it was self explanatory. The crib in which the baby sleeps in is a large, wrought iron type metal crib. It can’t be picked up let alone wheeled or lifted. It took over two hours to put together. I don’t currently have a portable crib or pack and play type thing that is safe for sleep."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my friend a deadbeat?,"This is a throwaway account because anytime my ex is mentioned anywhere, he threatens to sue me.

I am a 26 year old woman. Friend is a 27 year old man. We are both parents. Me to a 5 year old, him to a 7 year old, 5 year old, 4 year old, a 1 year old then 2 step kids. We live vastly different lives when it comes to parenting. I am a single mom and have been doing it without help for 2 years. He is a stay at home dad to his 1 year old and step kids. He hasnt seen his older 3 in 4 years. He doesnt even try to. He never even mentions his older kids.

We were playing online last night and talking about our kids when I mentioned that I saw his 2 oldest at the store the other day and how big they've gotten. He started going on a rant about evil women and how dare his kids mom keep them from him. I asked him if he had thought about taking her to court to demand visitation because his kids need him. He got angry and told me it wouldnt matter because he doesnt pay child support so it wouldnt happen. I tried to tell him child support and custody are two completely different issues.

He lost it on me. He told me how would I know because I ""keep my son away from his father""(I dont, hes refused all contact) and I'm probably making bank off of support(I dont because he doesnt pay it). He called me one of those shitty moms who has no right to say crap to a loving father.

I'll be honest, I didnt keep my cool. I told him it must be real nice to get to choose to be a dead beat and if he gave half a damn, he would try to do anything for his kids. That he couldnt complain about ""evil women"" when he wont put in the effort. I logged out. 

Now I feel like a major asshole to him because even if hes my oldest friend, it wasnt my place. Our other close friend said that he needed to hear it because he cant keep whining about it.

So reddit. Was I the asshole here?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my ex best friend to stop texting me about my dead daughter?,"my six year old daughter died a couple months ago and the mourning process is already difficult enough. my ex-best friend keeps texting me about my daughter and he says things such as “it’s a damn shame” and he’s in “pain” but he never even met my daughter! it’s tearing me to pieces so i blocked him! a bunch of our mutual friends say i’m being insensitive but i’m the one who lost my child. AITA?

EDIT: please stop asking me why he didn’t meet my kid. not everyone likes children. the whole situation was difficult and awful. i really regret posting this because now I’m the one who has given myself continuous reminders. every notification from this post is making this feel worse at this point in time. thank you all for the help but i’m no longer engaging with this post"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for lashing out at my friends to back off and not comment on my unconventional personal life?,"Firstly, let me clarify that this is not a click bait , validation post and neither do I have anger issues. My therapist has verified that. 

I came here because I feel lost and looking for an honest answer. I actually do feel like an asshole. I am in an ldr with a man from another country. Why? Because I come from a culture where women like me are not appreciated and options are next to none. I also have liberal values means it is impossible for me to be with someone local. I legit like this person and I don't want to lose him. We were best friends for few years lbefore we got together. Yes, there are risks in such an arrangement. Not denying that. But I am a consenting adult woman after all and I'm making an informed choice.. I accept the risks along with it.. 


Now the friends I have made over the years say nasty things to me like "" I don't have my shit together"" and "" They are concerned about me"" and that ""long distances never work"" And other have accused me of ""having a low self esteem"" And ""I'm being immature"" 

I have defended myself initially by saying ""there are no guaratees that local stuff work out as well"" And ""it is my choice after all"" But they won't back off..

After a while when they didn't back off I lashed out at them hard saying ""stay tf away from. My personal life. You don't get a right to decide and mind your own business."" I finally got tired and said "" I am breaking my friendship with all of you"" 

And I severed ties with them all. They are now blaming me that they were being caring but i lashed out and that had upsetted them. Am I the asshole here?."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for contemplating calling CPS on my next door neighbor for neglect?,"Our neighbors next door are a single mom, her mom, and her 6 year old son. Everyday he sits at a chair looking through our chain link fence for hours. He watches my kids play and I usually tell him he can come play in our backyard and eat over for lunch and dinner. I know his mom works full time but I rarely see anyone come and check on him. He never wants to go home.

Also, for his age he talks about a lot of inappropriate things. He tries to convince my 7 year old daughter to sneak out in the middle of the night with him and to keep it a secret from me and my husband. He also tries to kiss her a lot (which I know is normal for kids to do but combined with the talk about sneaking out it concerns me). There have also been a few occasions where he has physically hurt my 2 year old son on purpose. 

For extra context he has good hygiene, clean clothes, and seems to be fed. 

Am I being an asshole and overreacting? I don’t want to ruin a family over nothing. I just want to do the right thing for the child."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting the kids I nanny create fake words in Scrabble?,"I (F22) babysit fairly often as an extra source of income, and recently I’ve been nannying for a family with kids who are stuck at home while the parents both have essential jobs to go to.  There are 2 kids, a 10 year old boy and an 8 year old girl.  Before the pandemic this was a family I babysat for every now and then over the course of maybe a year, but since the schools closed down I’ve been a daytime nanny for them 2-3 times a week.

Recently I took it upon myself to play educational games with the kids in order to keep their brains sharp.  While they still had homework assigned that I would sit down and help them with, I thought that since it was considered “school hours” I would keep things as educational as I could while I was with them.  Recently one of the games I played with them was Scrabble, one of their favorites.  A classic game about making words with the letters you have available.  A perfect example of a game you can easily make educational and fun.

Only one problem:  the kids were having more fun making up fake words than spelling out real ones. I was patient with them at first and tried my best to set a good example by spelling out real words myself when my turns came.  However they wouldn’t stop goofing off and would keep making up new animal names and foods instead of creating real words.  I eventually got annoyed enough to give up and end the game and took it away from them, and told them if they weren’t going to take it seriously they weren’t allowed to play.  This made them really upset but I stood my ground and told them no, and had them start a new activity.

The next day when I arrived in the morning, before the mom left, she pulled me aside to talk to me in private.  It turns out the kids complained to their mom about my strict scrabble rules and how I took it away from them.  The mom didn’t seem mad, and just simply said it’s ok if they play it the way they want.  I didn’t fight her on this and said ok.

Eventually the kids asked if we could play scrabble and.... I told them no.  Just because they were allowed to play it however they wanted to didn’t mean they were allowed to play it WHENever they wanted to, specifically when I was with them during education hours.  They got upset but I still told them no, and eventually had to put them into time out.  When they finally calmed down I got them distracted with a different game instead.

Since then, I’ve been only asked to nanny 1-2 times a week instead of the usual 3-4.  I can’t help but wonder if my strictness around scrabble has anything to do with it.  But like come on... it’s just scrabble. Am I really such a mean nanny for discouraging them from making up words?  AITA?

EDIT:

I feel the need to add that the parents hired me to do educational activities with the kids, including homework and educational games.  While I’m trying to of course make things fun for the kids, keeping their learning intact is a high priority for me as well as their parents. There were a number of different educational games I played with them that they liked, but scrabble is the one they wouldn’t take seriously.   And yes, they are allowed to play it however they want when I’m not around, however when I’m with them the focus needs to be on activities they can actually benefit from, not spelling out nonsense words."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for giving my parents a piece of their own medicine?,"So me and my parents have an awry relationship and because of universities shutting down I have to live with them. Anyway, I make sure to contribute and keep to my self but my parents have always been ones comment on my weight and the weight of others incessantly. 

To the point I have developed an eating disorder that I had to take matters into my own hands to unlearn all that nonsense. I’m home and I want to enjoy things I was able to afford to have the time to eat in college like pizza, so whenever I want to enjoy these things I’m instantly reminded I’m ruining my progress or they’ll make fun of other people to make me feel ashamed. 

Not only that but whenever I decline having pizza or anything else, they compliment me and say good job or you have so much willpower. 

I finally had enough because I have asked, I have sat down, I have tried my best having one on one conversations with them but they do not understand where their words are causing harm towards me. 

Finally I had enough and decide to make comments back, I noticed that the dishes was full in the kitchen sink and jammed pack to the point you couldn’t fill a pot and while I was doing them, my mother was passing by and I told her if she wouldn’t constantly make all these large portions she’d lose weight. 

Then I told my Dad shouldn’t have an entire pizza because he did 2 hours of outside work. 

I also told my mother that she shouldn’t put cake with every celebration just because Memorial Day was yesterday.

They all were shocked and upset that I would say things like that and told me to cut it out and then we started this argument about how suddenly it’s okay to treat me like this but if I do it back it’s practically bullying. I told my boyfriend and he said he thinks it’s a soft ESH and I was little more of asshole than they were but I feel like that’s downplaying how I feel and how I have an eating disorder. AITA?

Also just so you know I’m a little below average in weight and my parents are both overweight but not obese."
AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to try and fix my relationship with my friend after they started to date my ex?,"I (23F) dated my ex (28M) for 5 years 

Our relationship was healthy and fun at first, I then got pregnant and things went to hell, he stopped working so I was going to school and working so I could pay our expenses, he was extremely controlling and jealous- our relationship was unhealthy, we broke up and he came out as gay.

We co parent just fine but that’s it, I can’t move past what he did.

I’ve been friends with K (24M) for 9 years.

We haven’t seen or really spoken since March, which was weird since we’re usually close.

He posted a picture of himself and my ex kissing, when I asked he said they’d been dating for 2 years, I’ve only been split from my ex for a year, he wanted to wait to tell me, he doesn’t want agro with me since now we’ll be co parents! (It didn’t all happen this fast but I’m trying to sum it up) 

I told him I could remain neutral towards him in front of my daughter but that’s it, he’s been spamming me either apologising or saying he deserves happiness after dealing with his homophobic parents for so long, my ex deserves happiness and I can’t control who they date etc.

Apparently he’s ignoring our friends because he’s “devastated” over our friendship ending.

My friends are really torn, some say I’m the AH for trying to control his happiness and some agree that my ex shouldn’t have even been an option in his eyes, all want me to fix my friendship with him.

AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend the joke she sent me wasn’t funny?,"Kinda short, but we were just snapping and she sent me a “meme” if you want to call it that, but it was basically a picture of a dead guy lying in the ground with blood everywhere from a school shooting. It had Fortnite loot all around him 

I don’t really find shit like that to be really funny so I just responded with the emoji “😐”

She responded with “I love it when friends can’t take jokes”

Then I said that “I knew it was a joke but it just wasn’t funny to me lol” 

Then she just left me on opened lmao"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving an honest review for my friends business?,"
A long distance friend of mine recently started a business. She makes candles that are supposed to be burned to offer good health, protection, fortune, love, etc. She lost her job and invested most of her money in starting up this business. She has been asking other friends and me to support/promote her. 

Although I think the timing of the business and what it promotes is a little bit slimy, I tried to be a supportive friend. I understand her backstory, and hope that this is something she actually believes. I ordered a couple of candles from her. The two candles costed $30. 

I really love candles, essential oils, incense and the like. These candles were disappointing. I gave them 3/5 stars. I won’t post the whole review here due to lack of space, but I can share it if asked. 

I Posted the review, and some pictures of the candles on my IG, they were very pretty, and I thought that was good enough. 

I got a text from my friend expressing disappointment in my review. I told her that I liked the candle OK and left an honest review. I tried to support her so I didn’t understand the problem. She told me she was really depending on her network to help her start the foundation of the business, and she was really counting on her friends to leave her good reviews rather than reviews that may cost her. 

I got annoyed because I felt that she was being demanding and dishonest. I told her that if she wanted a better review that she should supply a better product. That made her upset, and she told me that her candles weren’t glade candles,they were to fulfill a purpose. I already had the thought that she was exploiting people, and I told her that if she was going to scam people she could at least make it smell good. 

She ended up posting our messages, and calling me out in front of several of our mutual friends for accusing her of being a charlatan. A couple of people have reached out to me and asked me why I went about this the way I did. One of my friends in particular says that if I didn’t like the candle I shouldn’t have posted a review, and that I was an asshole for that. I should have left it at an Instagram post only saying good things about the products. I was thinking that maybe it was best to be honest, but now I’m wondering if I missed something socially and I’m an asshole for posting the review. AITA?"
AmItheAsshole,Aita for telling my sister she needs to stop living through her kids?,"So when my older sister was younger, she was an avid dancer. My mother enrolled her in ballet classes since she could walk and she was a protege. I remember doing ballet as a child but wasn’t even a fraction as good as her. I quit when I was six, she continued and began competing competitively very young and dance became her life.


She did it five days a week every week for years, competing in between. She got into an amazing dance school on scholarship, and even made into one of the biggest ballet associations in America. Unfortunately she got into a really bad car accident in her mid twenties and broke many bones. She would never be able to dance again. 


My sister fell into extreme depression after this. Dance was her life since she had her first memories and now she would be dropped from her job and have to restart over in life. That was decades ago. We both now are in our fourties and have kids of our own.


My sister has three kids, two daughters and a son. She enrolled her daughters into ballet when they were babies. Didn’t think much of it, many parents that were dancers do. When she pulled them out of school (elementary) so they could do dance full term, I was a bit worried. She claimed she was homeschooling them but was at the studio 24/7.


Her daughters would either be traveling studying dance with top instructors around the world (She married very wealthy), working on material for new competitions, and attending summer school for ballet. Their entire lives involved around the sport while her husband stayed home with their son, they would be out and about. 

I never really had any concerns since I thought the kids loved it and were just as enthusiastic. They are now 12 and 14. Since quarantine and everything’s come to a halt, they can only dance in their home studio. Their mother makes them still get up every morning at 7 and dance till 1, break for lunch, then dance till 6 then end for the day. 


I overheard my niece complaining to my daughter on FaceTime about this. She kept going on and said she and her little sister asked her mom if they can go to regular school and stop dance many times over the years and their mom says no! From what my sister paints, they love dance and are the ones begging to make it their entire life. 


I admittedly spoke to my sister about this. I told her if her daughters want to drop ballet or just do it once every week, they should. And if they want to stop home schooling they should too. They can’t live her dream of becoming pros for her. She went off and told me to not parent her or her kids and that they only complain very rarely when they lose a competition or get bad feedback from a instructor. Aita?"
AmItheAsshole,AITA for baking and eating a whole cake?,"Super silly but it’s caused a massive fight! So I (21F) graduated university last week, obviously there is no ceremony but I worked hard for years to get where I am and I was super proud. I wanted to do something to celebrate, so I decided to bake myself a cake. 

I asked my partner (25M), and my mother in law (53F) who is staying with us, if they had any preferences as to what type of cake I should make. They said no, partner said it was a waste of money and he wouldn’t pay for it, we should save our money for other things etc. I genuinely felt like I deserved this for working so hard so I went out and bought all the ingredients myself and made the cake on Wednesday afternoon. 

Cut to today, it’s been nearly a week and the small cake I baked as been eaten, I must say entirely by me but I did give a tiny tiny bit of sponge to my dog and some to my sister. 

My partner and mother in law decided to sit outside in the garden and day drink, since 11am, they called me out and asked for some cake, mother in law specifically wanted a “nice big slice of chocolate” I didn’t make chocolate. I told them there was none of the vanilla cake I made left and that they didn’t want any. I said there was some chocolate in the fridge she could have or I’d happy make her a sandwich or some pancakes if she was hungry. She lost her ever loving shit. Completely lost it. 

She started yelling and screaming I was selfish, how dare I not make a chocolate cake knowing that’s her favourite (I didn’t), she called me some horrible names, commenting on my weight for eating most of it etc. Now I’m not super thin, but I’m not fat either but I do have some issues with my weight and she did make me cry. 

Mother in law says I’m a selfish fat bitch, she said I’m useless and how can she trust me to care for her son if she cannot trust me to keep her some cake. She also said that I shouldn’t be celebrating graduating, she would only celebrate when I become a “proper wife” and I need to focus on her sons needs more instead of school. I said the cake was a week old, it needed to be eaten fast as it had fresh buttercream and fruit and even if there was some left, it wouldn’t have kept and she said she didn’t want any, it was a waste of money etc. Boyfriend said nothing. 

I’m now alone in my bedroom listening to her outside still yelling about me wondering if I really am the asshole? Should I have kept her some or should I have pushed a bit more to ask for their preferences instead of just accepting their first answer? 

TLTR; baked a cake a week ago, cake has now been eaten and a week later MIL wanted some. I said there was none left and she lost her shit basically.

EDIT; hi everyone, thank you so much for your comments! I’m trying my best to read them all, but I am definitely reevaluating my relationship. 

And to answer the question about the living situation, they are both staying with me. MIL came over for dinner, wanted to stay the night and basically never left, it’s been 9 months! I have tried to ask her to leave but I have autism and my communication isn’t great so she never takes me seriously! But I think it’s time to do something, thank you"

unpopularopinion,People over 65 shouldn't get to run a country,"Trying to imagine my own grandfather running the country with the same ideals and standards and slightly outdated views that he picked up from his years in college and graduate school in the 1960's would be an absolute disaster. He's an intelligent and progressive man, and was very valuable in his field for years, but soon became very disconnected from the direction the world was moving... eventually you just run out of steam, or become impatient with things and find it harder to learn new skills and adapt to new ways of thinking.

Seeing Scandinavian countries with leaders who are younger and more in tune with the changes in society, and the different challenges current youth and young adults are facing economically is incredibly valuable. They seem to have an energy and drive to progress forward and it is so much more refreshing than watching these heavily aged candidates try and rally the country together in an effort to tie up their legacy before they die.

Edit: this was fun but I’m checking out now, gotta make dinner. I’m glad this provoked some controversy and conversation."
unpopularopinion,Kobe Bryant's death was tragic but has no right to be next to the worst events of 2020,"Alright, I get it. His death was tragic and was a loss to many people he influenced, But people still seem to be blowing it out of proportion. People made it seem like the world was ending and put more weight on his death then the Coronavirus reaching america back in January. I am also sick of only hearing his name when 8 other people died including his daughter. His death was tragic and untimely but it is in no way comparable to hundreds of thousands dying to Covid-19, Millions of people losing their jobs, the fires in Australia or any other thing that is happening in the world. There is so much crazy stuff happening that it does a disservice to say he had any part in the world running shit first into a fan. 

Speaking of fans, I get it, But Kobe is objectively not the best basketball player. I will link another post in the comments of him being overrated. However, my main point is that even if was the greatest player ever, we still lost more to sports as a whole from everything being closed now. 

I again would like to state that this is my opinion and I just am really surprised that people are still talking about him like he was some infallible legend. 

Please remember, HE WAS ONE PERSON."
unpopularopinion,Your average Joe doesn't have to reduce his carbon footprint and aid against climate change until big corporations and governments start trying.,"Pretty much, the average person's attempts to minimize their effect on climate change is a very valiant cause, but will do nothing in the long-run until corporations and governments own up to their shortcomings and do something about it. Governments burning fossil fuels and corporations dumping trash into the oceans and not doing anything to reduce their carbon footprints is going to be the last straw for humans. If we continue like this, then climate change is in my opinion going to be the one that kills a majority of the population. The quote, ""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"" really applies here. It's great that people do their bit in helping, but until governments and companies do something, the world will continue in the downward spiral that it's on. Until governments start use renewable energy instead of coal or corporations reduce their carbon footprint, you or I don't have to do anything because our small contribution won't really change anything.

Yeah, a person taking a shorter shower and riding a bike is for a great cause and should be supported, but it means close to nothing. Big businesses and governments have to own up and need to make huge efforts to remedy climate change.

Edit: So I see a lot of people saying that the Average Joe's job is to vote for candidates that have a policy like that. I absolutely agree! You guys have actually changed my opinion a little, but I still think that it should be the government/potential candidate and corporations that take the initiative. I know that is a bit of wishful thinking because that's putting a lot of faith in people where this isn't a priority, but the initiative is really key here in my opinion."
unpopularopinion,The most abusive parents are usually the ones that look perfect to outsiders and neighbors.,"I don't know how common this phenomena is but from my experience the parents who raise the most damaged children are usually the ones who everyone loves and look up to as model parents.

They provide anything material the children need, they have a solid and good life plan for them and help them with everything they need. They seem to have time to attend to everything their children participates in and are very sociable and friendly to fellow parents in any social event."
unpopularopinion,"If your cat looks like it swallowed a bowling ball and is obviously chonk, it is NOT cute. It is irresponsible and should be considered animal abuse.","I  am getting so tired of seeing posts promoting or celebrating significant chonk in pets. Being that large shortens your pets life and dramatically reduces  its quality of life. It can lead to bone, muscle and digestive problems than can cause your animal chronic pain.

Your pet cannot choose its diet, so if you overfeed you are forcing it to face these consequences. On the other side of the coin, if you never  play with your cat or walk your dog and it falls into a sedentary  lifestyle and gets that big...that’s also on you.

Not trying shame thic boi's, I just want all pets to be happy and healthy and live a great fucking life."
unpopularopinion,It’s OK to say you are a fan of a band even if you just like a few of their most famous songs.,"I don’t get why people have such a problem with ‘posers’ or ‘annoying fans’.

They are still fans. They still like the same stuff you do. They are still supporting your favorite artist.

Music is music, enjoy it for what it is."
unpopularopinion,Homework does more harm to high schoolers than good (read full post),"Kids do an average of 2-3.5 hours of homework a day according to multiple studies [like this one](https://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?cid=25920011&item=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.edweek.org%2Fv1%2Fblog%2F159%2Findex.html%3Fuuid%3D37844), [this one](https://www.statisticbrain.com/highschool-homework-statistics/), [and this one](https://www.princetonreview.com/press/student-life-american-teens). School also lasts about 7 hours, which means the average student has a workday of 9-10 hours, longer than the working adults already high ([and wasteful](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html)) 8.8 hour workday. Homework obviously helps students do better on tests, but any good homework assignment should be able to accomplish that in 15 minutes, and should only be given when needed. This makes a student work a lot less on homework (45 minutes to 90 minutes usually based on the amount of classes that assign homework) which is a good thing as now students still have the choice to study and get the full three hour benefit, work on hobbies or sports, and maybe get 8 hours of sleep. My last point was hard to fit in, as it is very unrelated, but homework on the weekends, especially 3 or more hours, is teaching our kids that their jobs should extend to the weekend. This may make kids more likely to allow their future jobs to give them work when it should be their time off. I am assuming this opinion is unpopular, especially since it is very hard to explain to anybody as a high schooler, as they just think I’m complaining and shut me out.

(Edited for spelling errors, comment if you see any more)"
unpopularopinion,Tripping Kids as they run around the restaurant should be made legal,Get tired of kids running around being rowdy as hell when its a restaurant and not a playground alongside inconsiderate parents who just let it happen. You are here to eat not run in the way of the waiters trying to bring the food to the customers. You parents gotta start smacking your kids for this if telling them to not do it once isn't enough.
unpopularopinion,r/fragilewhiteredditor is filled with racists who are just as bad as the people they call out and are equally fragile,"That sub is the most ironic thing to ever exist. They took sub names like r/fragileblackredditor and r/fragilefemaleredditor and made them redirects for their own sub, proving the double standard that if the same things they do were done to another race, there would be riots. Another example is it getting to stay up, but r/fragilejewishredditor did not.

The entire sub consists of cherrypicking comments and posts to make anyone white look like a Confederate soldier, not making or enforcing any effort to censor names for the sake of privacy, and exposing that user to endless messages and comments filled with racial slurs. I made it onto there for posting an unpopular opinion in **THIS SUB** (shocker, I know) and spent the next 24 hours being called cracker and mayo, and getting messages telling me that Europe should be nuked. Yet somehow the fragile one is me.

Subs like this just make the racial divide they hate so much even stronger; they don't actually give a damn about stopping racism, they just want excuses to do it themselves. Anyone who uses those hate subs should not be taken seriously"
unpopularopinion,Doing badly in school shouldn't reflect your abilities as an adult.,"Yes, this is an experience of mine. A lot of people will argue differently because it's an ""unpopular opinion"" obviously. I have built up years of experience and knowledge in order to gain a position at a company I know I can do well in, however they discovered that I failed Maths 16 years ago therefore I cannot progress. I have enrolled on a course to improve this even though I passed 5 interview stages out of 10 people. Am I wrong? It's like the everything I have built up over the past 16 years has no value. Maybe I am not seeing this from a perspective I should be, if that's the case. Then sorry for being a dick."
unpopularopinion,"I'm getting sick of Japanese media (games, anime, etc.) being so horny all the time.","Let me preface this by stating that I am not anti-porn or anti-sexuality. I just feel like, compared to western media, most Japanese games and anime have this layer of horniness spread over it that detracts from the actual value of the product.

I'm not saying that I don't want sex in my video games. I think when it's in games like The Witcher 3, where there's a very distinct switch from Serious Time to Sexy Time and most characters are dressed sensibly for their character and personality, it's no issue. (monsters being topless being one example that I think actually reinforces my idea) 

In contrast, Japanese games (and anime) are stuck in this weird soft-porn limbo where there's always the innuendo, sexy costumes (no nudity!), and porno voices, but no actual sex occurs. Rather than focusing the sexiness into more in-depth, adult settings, it's kinda just prevalent throughout the entire production as a vague horniness, like the game is trying to keep me slightly aroused throughout for some reason. The majority of the time you're only gonna see sex and nudity if it's a porno or some ecchi anime. 

Anyway I just want my serious times and sexy times to be a bit more delineated instead of just an embarrassing soft-porn horn-fest all the time. That's my opinion after watching anime and playing games for 2 decades or so.

Edit: TL;DR fanservice is a shameless ploy to hook in horny teenagers and I'd prefer they either get rid of it or go all the way."
unpopularopinion,"Even if your doggo is the goodest, most well trained doggo in the whole wide world, you’re still being a douche if you walk them without a leash","This is apparently a very unpopular opinion in the part of Colorado I live in. My dog has been in two scary fights in the last month while I’ve been out on a walk. In both, my dog was on a leash, and the other dog was not. My dog admittedly has a different demeanor around off leash dogs when he’s on a leash (he’s just fine in dog parks). But in both instances, the other dog came rushing up to mine as I was walking (despite the other owner calling for them) and almost instantly the dogs got into a fight. I had to be the one to break up the two mid sized dogs (40ish pounds) on both occasions, but the off leash dog was especially tough to get away from my own. 

On both occasions, the other owner insisted that this “never happens with their dog,” took zero responsibility, and had the audacity put fault on myself and my own dog. When I brought up that perhaps their dog should have been on a leash, they turned it around and implied I needed to get with the times and to mind my own business.

I’m still salty about this issue. Obviously it’s a slightly different issue if an owner is taking their dog on a walk in a secluded, cordoned off area - but I live in a residential part of the city and off leash doggos are very common in the community I live in.

EDIT: From some of the comments I should have clarified that my thread was meant for folks walking their dogs in **public, well populated areas** that are not designated off-leash areas like dog-parks."
unpopularopinion,"True gender equality will be marked by nonchalance towards, not celebration of gender.","If true gender equality comes to fruition, then what it will mean is that people will stop giving a fuck about one another's gender. Everyone would have equal opportunity, treatment, respect and appreciation, while being judged based on character, ability, personality and other proper grounds based on the situation. There would be no need for gender-based celebrations, since all related hurdles would have already been crossed. 

What will be celebrated though, is mankind coming one step closer to overall human equality."
unpopularopinion,Video game streaming is the most boring shit ever,"No disrespect to streaming nor the hustle, but I honestly don't know how these people sit through HOURS of some gamer's Twitch stream. It's so friggin' boring! 

There are lots of streamers that make a great living off of it, and good for them! I'm not bashing on the streamers themselves, I just don't understand how people sit and watch these things for *literal* hours.

It seems like it would make more sense to just watch a highlight montage or some 10 min video of a play through. During a livestream everything is raw and uncut. Loading screens, buffering, long silences, and so much other annoying shit."
unpopularopinion,"If you opt out of organ donation, you shouldnt get one.","The UK has said all legal adults are on the organ donation registry. Since it has been announced, people have opted out. 

I think if you opt out, you shouldnt recieve one if you need one.

Edit cause some people are right. 

Ill change it to those who opt out selfishly. As in not for genetic or religious reasons but simply because they dont want to donate upon death."
unpopularopinion,Telling a man he has a ‘fragile ego’ does not mean you won the argument,"I see this all over Twitter and this site , a male makes a statement with no bad intentions and a hoard of women comment on his masculinity and get  thousands of likes ,surely having a fragile ego isn’t the answer to everything ?  also getting more likes on your comment does mean you are right"
unpopularopinion,People that say they can’t watch a cartoon or a anime because it’s supposed to be for kids are just being stuck up,Some of the best thing I’ve seen in media are cartoons or anime and I’ve had tons of people tell me things like “ Avatar can’t be good it’s for kids” or “ This show is animated I can’t take it seriously”
unpopularopinion,We treat Americans unfairly on the internet,"Any time an American is on the internet and brings up an “unconventional” opinion an unfair joke is made and everyone congratulates the insulted.

For instance, on r/murderedbywords , half of the submissions are just the same format of 

American opinion

School shooting/fat people/burger joke 

Upvotes to the left for that comedy, people

Disclaimer- I am not a salty American, I am from Scotland and never visited America in my life"
unpopularopinion,'influencers' are entitled unemployed people,"if theyre big, they charge thousands per post and dont negotiate on prices while all they do is post a picture of said product ??? thats not a job and very easy too."
unpopularopinion,Every person once they hit 70 should be made to retake a driving test every 2 years,"The amount of crashes you hear about where old people have accidentally planted the accelerator instead of the brake and ploughed into people/bulldings/vehicles, or are travelling at 20mph in a 40 and braking every slight corner, holding up the rest of the road.

I think every 2 years is a reasonable length of time to evaluate elderly people, and I also believe no one should drive over the age of 90. Reaction times are just too slow to be safe on the roads."
unpopularopinion,Fake freckles are stupid and not cute,"Title says it all, but I think it's annoying when people put on fake freckles. I have a ton of freckles so I can always tell they are fake, and it doesn't make you any more cuter. Just use your natural skin because you are more beautiful being yourself.

Add on: I'm not saying that freckles aren't cute. I am saying that fake freckles look fake and are something I do not enjoying looking at personally."
unpopularopinion,"I don't care what type of show it is, if it has fake laugh tracks, I'm not watching it.","I don't care if it's a tv channel/show, if it's a series, or any type. 

For one reason, it always, **ALWAYS** feels pushed and just makes the entire atmosphere horrible. Even if l absolutely adored a show, if it had canned laughter, that's the last of it. **P o i n t.**"
unpopularopinion,The idea that so many women will only date men who are 6ft or above is absolutely a myth perpetrated by men.,"I’ve literally only encountered this as something talked about by guys in the internet and I’m shocked anyone would think it’s a widespread thing. I’ve got a lot of female friends and have never heard any of them use that as a standard in dating. I mean logically why would they, most men (like 85%) would be eliminated from the dating pool if someone did hold that. Also it’s genuinely very hard to guess what someone’s height is, personally I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between 5ft 10 and 6ft.

I have heard girls say they have a preference towards dating a guy who’s taller than them, but when the average female height is like 5 ft 4, that really doesn’t disqualify many guys at all. Even then there’s a decent amount of girls who don’t mind dating shorter guys, myself included. 

Conclusion - if you’re not incredibly short but complain that you can’t get a date because of your height, consider the fact that it might just be you."
unpopularopinion,"Reddits constant edginess about religion is just immature, disrespectful & super hacky","I'm not even a huge bible thumper every  comment chain is ""Lol sky wizard"" or some similarly other overdone joke.


To be fair, I do NOT care about the jokes themselves. Bill Burrs ""Don't you think the Catholic church went a little too far?"" Is a classic & hilarious. I respect anyone creating their own jokes.



But the trend of just trying to be super literal hyperbolic with past religions thinking it's funny has become grade A hack material. For example ""Why bc your sky wizard told you to?"", ""Because a bunch of people are idiots & go to church to eat human flesh of their savior."". There is no real punchline in these jokes outside of the unexpected shock of someone dissing religion which is par for the course on reddit. Its basically become the ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" of religion.


It just feels like I'm 13 again hanging out w/ my buds on reddit going ""Yeah man you know how many wars were fought for religion?""



I honestly think it's less of a anti-religion thing for a lot of people and more of a faux intelligence ""Look at me & how smart I am for not believing this"""
unpopularopinion,Dumbledore was never gay,"JK Rowling clearly demonstrated a traditional view of marriage throughout the books. All of a sudden the fans start ranting about Dumbledore’s orientation. She didn’t suddenly reveal that they were right all along. She just changed it to make more money. For all the Harry Potter crackheads reading, stop pretending that it wasn’t anything more than just a business decision."
unpopularopinion,Pugs are fucking gross and aren’t cute,"Pugs are the ugliest stinkiest fuckers you can get and i fucking hate them. They make ungodly noises that make me wanna puke, they look like they got punt kicked in the face and they’re always snotty.

Lemme ask you a question? You ever picked up a pugs shit? Lemme tell you it is some of the most rancid smelling dog shit one can smell. They are also really fucking loud not when they need attention or anything, just in general. Also they’re annoying god I fucking hate pugs"
unpopularopinion,The people defending the woman who lied to the police in Central Park are racists. Amazing how people suddenly are pro false accusations.,"Every single day, several times a day, we get complaining about how horrible false accusations are, and how severely women should be punished for making them.

Suddenly when we are literally watching a woman invent a false accusation live on video, we get a flood of posts how that was OK because she might have been scared.

One hell of a transition guys. False accusations are useful and valid now? I wonder if the races were reversed, would a black woman lying to the police on the phone to get a white man in trouble be OK too? Is she allowed to be scared and lie?"
unpopularopinion,Even if you win a debate the other opinion isn't inherently wrong,"A lot of people just don't know how to properly argue for different forms of view. I think that a lot of people just end up becoming flustered because deep down they know that their opinion has more merit than how it seemed when they argued it. 

A lot of people will find a weak debater, beat them in a debate, and then act like it somehow proves all their opinions were trash. 

Not only do you need a LOT of information memorized about a certain topic but you also need to be quick witted and good at improv. A lot of people just aren't able to do justice to their own opinions. That doesn't mean the stance itself is right or wrong. 

Now, yes these people SHOULD re-evaluate their opinion on something if they can't properly debate it... But realistically this doesn't happen and I can't control people. 

What we each can do, however, is try to argue against ourselves in order to find the truth."
unpopularopinion,Sjws have an addiction to feeling righteous,"A lot of sjws don't really care about the shit they're talking about, they just are addicted to feeling righteous.

Feeling righteous makes them feel as if they are amazing, remarkable people. And they really like those feelings. 

So they continue to be annoying about everything for the sake of constantly feeling those feelings.

It's an addiction."
unpopularopinion,There are more pushy meat eaters than there are pushy vegetarians.,"I ate meat until early January, and I never really got pressured by annoying vegetarians/vegans. I had a *ton* of vegetarian and vegan friends, and none of them ever really tried to pressure me into giving up meat. I also live in Brooklyn, so it's not like there's a lack of vegetarians/vegans anywhere lmao. The only time I can think of was this annoying high schooler, but we were in debate club so I guess it makes sense.

However, I've been a vegetarian since January 2020, and the amount of resistance people give to me is insane. I'm not a pushy vegetarian. I hardly ever mention being vegetarian, only doing so when it comes up in conversation or we're talking about food or something, and I *never* have judged someone for eating meat. Yet every time it's revealed I'm vegetarian people respond horribly. They'll spend ages talking about how ""no no no meat is good for you"" and ""ohmygod I didn't think you were one of *those* type of people lol"" and ""c'mon it's just *animals*"". Like what?? Almost every meat eater I mention being vegetarian to tries to convince me to start eating animals again, whereas 99% of vegetarians I have met don't give a fuck if other people eat meat or not."
unpopularopinion,13 reasons why is a bad depiction of mental health and should not be taken seriously,"For those who are unaware, 13 reasons why is a show about a girl who commits suicide and leaves behind tape recordings of why she did it. The whole message of the show seems to be that suicide is a good solution to your problems. An example of this is how Clay one of the characters in the show goes on a crusade of vigilante justice against the people on the tapes. 

It presents an idea that suicide is a method of vengeance towards those who wronged you. As a psychiatry resident I find this message very problematic, also in season 3 they try to make sexual assault victims into the bad guys. While justifying a serial rapist, ( Bryce walker) 

In season 1 it shows a scene of the girl killing herself, and the guidelines in my country at least. Do not recommend that suicide scenes be shown, and that they should only be implied. This is because scenes that show suicide could cause something called inspirational suicide (not sure if the term is correct). 

Basically In general the show is bad, and I do not recommend it for viewers who may be struggling with issues mentioned in the series. Also the writing and dialogue makes no sense and the characters actions are often inconsistent with their motivations."
unpopularopinion,Hollywood should stop inventing African countries,"Hollywood uses real countries in when stories are set in other continents but almost always invents a fictional one when it comes to Africa. To make it worse, these fictional nations are always monarchies yet the continent only has 3 monarchies and 51 republics. Swaziland and Lesotho are tiny, insignificant and completely surrounded by South Africa. Morocco is the only significantly large monarchy. Is it so hard to set a story in Nigeria, Kenya or Congo? Why do we have to put up with weird sounding places like Wakanda or Luambo?"
unpopularopinion,Higher paid jobs aren't harder then minimum wage jobs,"So 6 years ago I was washing cars at a dealership. 12 years ago I worked in food service. Between those I did retail. And within the past 6 years I worked retail sales.

My last 2 jobs (current and previous) are paying me a base salary of over 60k with total comp in the 6 figures. I work from home, very successful and quite frankly don't work that hard.

But holy fuck, retail, food service and washing cars was significantly more difficult than these jobs have been. Physically and mentally. 

As you make more jobs become less difficult. However they become less difficult with experience and education (which I have a ton of both)."
unpopularopinion,Batman is a useless selfish prick,"So he spends millions on all this tech on a fancy car and silly costumes and his fancy batcave? So he can what? Bully a clown with mental health problems and punch a couple of muggers each night? Muggings are bad but its well within the polices capability to deal with. He has endless resources that could fund the causes of crime like poverty, better schooling, funding the police. Or even activities for youths. But instead he wastes it farting about in the dark like a bellend coz he just wants to look hard in front of his elderly butler slave pal. Mans got the money to fund a cancer cure ffs. Well he can suck a big fat one."
unpopularopinion,"We need to stop framing Nuclear energy as this evil, dangerous thing that we need to stop using","You read the title.

It's by far the safest and one of the cleanest method of energy production available to us right now.

No like seriously, there have been such few meltdowns that you could probably name all of them in under a minute. And although each of these accidents has been catastrophic, the death toll is still dwarfed by all of the mining accidents, oil rig accidents, deaths by gas leaks, and even accidents that happen whilst building dams and wind farms.

It is not an argument, Nuclear power is ***the*** safest option available.

The world needs to switch from fossil fuel to Nuclear now. It's the only solution to climate change. Expecting third world countries (or corrupt regimes like China, that don't give two shits about the Environment) to start building massive wind or solar farms is just not a realistic approach. We need to switch to Nuclear, and then slowly convert to Renewables when the threat of Climate change is (mostly) out of the picture. Or just pour funding into Fusion research and skip straight to that.

And whilst you might be wondering about Nuclear waste, well the thing is, there is just so little of it. The amount that will gather up in the 100 or so years it will take us to switch to Renewables or Fusion can simply be dug underground in remote locations or even shot into Space if that becomes cheap enough someday."
unpopularopinion,It doesn't matter if it's just a drawing. Sexualising children in any way is fucking creepy and disgusting.,"I see this kind of stuff all the time on subreddits like r/rule34 and related subreddits. People depict characters that have been 100% confirmed to be underage, and at times even below the age of consent in many countries (several Pokemon and anime characters, for instance), getting fucked or showing off their boobs and whatnot. It's disgusting and uncomfortable. They're *kids*. It doesn't matter if it's a drawing or not. And I'm really sick of the normalisation of this kind of paedophilia.

Hell, this shit is actually straight-up illegal in several countries, including the United States. Section 1466A of Title 18 of the U.S. Code specifically makes it illegal to create, view, or distribute visual representations—including drawings—of minors engaging in sexual acts.

This shit needs to stop. It's horrible and sickening."
unpopularopinion,"Stop using the term ""toxic masculinity""","This term is thrown around way too loosely these days to describe any negative trait displayed by a man such as repressing emotions or assaulting women or people weaker than them when in reality none of these traits are masculine at all. Masculinity from what I understand is being strong emotionally and striving to be the best you can. 
If a man picks on people weaker than them, overcompensates in their masculinity then they ain't masculine."
unpopularopinion,Redditors are assholes,No offense but hear me out. So I’m pretty new to Reddit. Sure I’ve had my account for a while but I rarely use it. Why? Well until today I didn’t really have a reason but if I did it’d be because Redditors can be pricks. I like gaming and Fallout so I naturally I joined a Fallout subreddit and made the mistake of actually putting my opinion about my favorite F4 faction the Brotherhood of Steel on a shitpost about it. Immediately people just start downvoting my comment for no reason and pretty much being assholes about it. People even started calling me Hitler because I like the BOS. What’s with Redditors and being complete jerks? A game subreddit should be fun and spark an interesting conversation and while there were many people who could be civil most were pieces of shit. *sigh* Patrolling Reddit almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
unpopularopinion,I hate the term “new normal.” I just want to go back to normal.,"Don’t get me wrong, I am all for social distancing and mask wearing etc, I am specifically referencing the term “new normal.” Why is the goal not “back to normal”? New normal really rubs me the wrong way. It shouldn’t be normal to not visit our grandparents, stay 6 feet away from everyone around us, stand in long lines outside stores, not shake hands, and cover our faces. These are temporary measures we’re taking as a society FOR society - to get back to normal, not to make this the norm. Even if we have to do all this for the next 1-2 years I can’t call any of that normal, especially not the “new normal.”"
unpopularopinion,Twitter is by far the most toxic social media platform,"I’ve been on everything and i’m yet to see anything as bad as things I see on a daily basis on twitter

I despise Reddit at times but even it isn’t nearly half as bad, probably due to being able to downvote

but Twitter actually makes me lose faith in humanity and makes me realise how terrible the world is

everyday my TL is flooded with retweets of dumb takes with tens of thousands of likes and retweets

every single thread is one group hating another group, the cancel culture is disgusting

it’s full of entitled narcissists who’ve never been told no and have no counter points other than spamming gifs or saying things that are the equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and blocking the other person out

i’ve never even got in a twitter argument because i don’t need the stress lol, but i’m finding it impossible to follow the people, companies, games i like without somehow getting some intense drama on my TL every. single day.

it’s people that shouldn’t have a platform to put their opinion on, racists against whites and poc, hypocrites, people who have no idea how the world works, and despite most of it all being completely serious views and opinions, any backlash just gets met with “it’s obviously a joke” 

it makes me heated lol i’m uninstalling but i have no idea how people use twitter it’s nothing but a rabbit hole of miserable people with nothing better to do than argue online all day

it’s just an app designed for people to argue with each other 

and don’t even get me started on the amount of people who spend dozens of hours researching peoples past to “cancel” them and being praised, as if it isn’t a clear sign of serious mental illness’s and unhealthy coping mechanisms"
unpopularopinion,Horoscopes should be met with the same level of scrutiny as every other form of Pseudo-Science.,"Maybe it's me, but Horoscopes seem to get a free pass, where as the healing rocks, flat-earthers and I would say the religious types come under fire.

It boggles my mind that people who believe the world is flat are comically brushed off, but believing that the position of space rocks, or your time of birth somehow affects your personality is accepted by the majority of people.

On a few occasions I've asked people who believe in Horoscopes what they think of religion and many of them have brushed it off as superstitious nonsense, which to me is comical that the concept of a man in the sky deciding your actions is nonsensical but a rock doing so is perfectly fine.  


Just in case it comes up in the comments;

unpopularopinion,"If most people don’t like you, you are the problem, not them.","I get it that there are some people who just won’t like you for stupid shit like they’re jealous of you. Maybe there are people who just aren’t interested in clicking with you cause you don’t have much in common. However, if pretty much all of your acquaintances and potential friends don’t like you, the problem is most likely you, not them. When this happens to a lot of people, a they tend to blame those who dislike them instead of thinking about how certain behaviors they displayed can turn a lot of people off.

Edit: I am specifically referring to western society today. I know this very well may not be the case in other countries with different cultures."
unpopularopinion,Prisoners in the United States should be allowed to vote in elections.,"I think all prisoners, regardless of their crime should be allowed to vote in elections. Their entire life is at the mercy of government policy, and the government has a larger direct impact on their lives than it does on non incarcerated people. If the purpose of incarceration is rehabilitation, shouldn’t we want the incarcerated to have a buy in the the society they hope to rejoin? If incarceration is punitive, how does giving the incarcerated the right to vote diminish the security of society. I have yet to hear a good argument as to why the incarcerated citizens of this country shouldn’t be allowed to vote."
unpopularopinion,Glass elevators are cool,"Never understood why they were just a fad. It sucks that newer small to mid-sized high-rises don’t incorporate them in their designs (to my knowledge). 

As far as elevator experiences go, nothing is better than watching the external or internal scenery of the building fly by on the way to your floor. Glass elevators are also cool to look at from the outside because of how they can be observed zooming up and down with their occupants inside."
unpopularopinion,"People who film themselves crying, or breaking down don't deserve to be consoled.","If you're clear headed enough to get your phone out and record yourself having some kind of episode, you don't need any more attention. It's not cute. I don't feel bad for you. It's fucking cringe to the max. I have been seeing way too many videos of people of all kinds, bawling and sniffling and looking disgusting all red in the face snot dripping down their nose, and complaining about trivial bullshit. This guy flipped me off, I don't want to wear a mask, my girlfriend broke up with me. It's all fucking pathetic and maybe I'm just falling into some kind of troll pit, because there are so many tiktoks and snaps of people sobbing, and then trying to make it entertaining? It's fucking revolting, and it comes off so immature and manipulative. All those fucking kids who fake cried to their parents and got coddled for it haven't learned. Your crocodile tears make you look like a bitch. Emotions are good, everyone has them and everyone should express them, but there's a time and a place and the internet ain't it."
unpopularopinion,"I hate the ""I'm socially awkward to a fault. Love me please"" movement on social media","Not sure if it's just me but the amount of memes I see that are essentially I've never been an rs,/ I'm unlovable/ I'm soooo awakard/ anxious I've never been on a date, but Love me anyway is irritating especially when it's like the same type of dude. Scrawny/fat weeby kinda dude and more.than half the time, it's an Asian dude.. And especially bc I am asian American it bugs me more since it  perpetuates the fact that asian males are always gonna be effeminate. Like they're always posting about he's never held hands with a girl at age 23 Like how hard is it to bite the bullet and just ask to go on a date. Like fr, its like their dad/uncle's/older family members never taught them how to hit on girls."
unpopularopinion,"Instead of always accepting everything because it's how it is, we should be asking why it is the way it is.","With everything in life. Way too many people just happily accept anything and everything just because ""it's the way it is"" or ""it's the way life made it"" without really thinking deeply about anything, about why things are the way they are. For example; tornadoes. What is the point of tornadoes? They don't do anything but cause destruction. Yet if I asked someone that, they would be like ""its just nature, it's just the way it is"" without actually thinking about the overall question and point: Why does something like this exist? It's not really needed in life and does nothing but create negativity. Of course it is what it is, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't think about things radically or from a different perspective. People are just so ready to dismiss anything that requires deep and provoking thinking so they just cast it away as ""it is what it is"". Why is almost every ""system"" (with everything) in America so complicated? You'd figure a lot of these things would be revised and simplified already considering it's 2020. But ""it is what it is"". Of course this is my own perspective and opinion so it really doesn't necessarily matter if you agree or not (that's also not the point of this subreddit). But why is everything always ""it is what it is"" instead of thinking about it perceptively?"
unpopularopinion,"Communism has the chance to work, but as humans it cannot","Communism seems ideal: everyone gets what they need, no one owns anything, and you work at the job you love. It seems like a perfect world. However, human nature just makes this not happen. Humans aspire for more. Someone will want power over the others, and the balance fails. Communism fails, but it’s because we are only human and seek advancement."
unpopularopinion,Men are praised too much for performing tasks expected from women,"Hello Reddit, I am a man too and I am all for equality of course. Recently, my mother broke her hip in an unfortunate accident. All her sisters and family are calling her and asking her questions such as: ""Who is going to cook and clean? How is anything going to get done?"" and everyone is super impressed when she tells them I will do it. I know it sounds like fake humility, but why is everyone impressed when a guy can cook and clean. If I were a woman everyone would just take this for granted. It isn't like I am doing her a favour (I was already helping before, but now I am obviously doing everything), these things should be expected from men too. It applies to other things too, for example if a guy changes their kid's diaper or something. Like wow he is such a good guy. 

I don't know maybe it's just my experience, but seriously it's patronising towards me a bit, and ofc it is much more insulting towards women. It seems that they're expected to be housewives by default."
unpopularopinion,Nuts should have no place in banana bread.,"Nuts are good in sweets in which the rest of the constituents are chewy and dense, for example, a Snickers bar. 

However, nuts in banana bread? Absolutely not. Nuts in cake? How dare you."
unpopularopinion,Taking and sending nudes is one of the dumbest things ever.,I think that nudes are a stupid way to show your attracted to someone. You shouldn’t be judged from what is under your clothes. It should be a person’s personality and even just their face. Also they can often be used as blackmail as is often done.
unpopularopinion,The pay should be one of the first things the company tells you during the hiring process,"Seriously, I don't understand why companies think it's taboo to mention the job's pay.  I'm 19 so maybe it changes as you get older, but most companies don't list the pay on their site and they won't mention it unless you ask.  The point of a job is to make money so of course, I'm going to care about how much I'm getting paid.

Also, so many jobs will post on their site things like ""competitive wages"" or ""pays above the minimum wage.""  I recently applied to a job that advertised this and I find out that the pay is 7.30.  Five cents above the minimum wage."
unpopularopinion,There is no compromising with conservatives that make misinformation and conspiracy theories an opinion.,"I know people push that compromise is important. We should be open minded. However, there is no way to be open minded with people that don’t base their opinions off of credible sources. Their opinions should not be accepted or even respected."
unpopularopinion,Being overly positivite is better than being negative,"When you think negative, you already set yourself up for failure since you already told yourself that it most likely won't happen, so it won't. On the other hand, if you tell yourself that it will happen, you're more keen to working harder. Even if it still doesn't, that's just motivation to work 3x harder."
unpopularopinion,having a mental illness does not allow you to be irresponsible or rude,"tldr below

speaking from personal experience, i had a serious depressive episode during a major exam period. my friends were so nice but somehow my brain told me to chase them away. when they offered to stay alongside me, i would shout at them because my logic was if they got angry, there'd be one less person who would be sad when i commit suicide.

but when a classmate talked to me about it, i realised that i was wrong. it's just like having anger issues and murder. if you kill someone because you have anger issues, that doesn't make the murder okay. You have a reason for it, but it is still wrong. similarly, shouting at my friends was wrong, even though justifiable.

for the irresponsibility part, it was because i had no energy to do any homework. I slept during class and slept when i went home because i just didn't have energy to do anything. i admit i was being irresponsible. so i told my teachers and my friends about it every time i could commit to something, so they would understand, and luckily, they were very accepting. if you are in this situation, i think the least you could do is to explain it to others, and try to better yourself step by step.

tldr: wrong will still be wrong, no matter what circumstance you are in. it isn't your fault you are struggling, but that is still your responsibility, and does not mean you should abuse other's patience."

unpopularopinion,"I hate when people say “nobody asked for your opinion” people can say whatever the fuck they like, nobody needs to ask for it","I see it time and time again when a negative opinion is posted in the comments section, everyone downvotes it to hell and says “nobody asked for your opinion” Like I don’t care if the opinion is shitty, everyone has a right to freely express how they feel about something. Just because it’s negative doesn’t mean you’re suddenly not allowed to voice it"
unpopularopinion,Video games are better than movies,"I’m going out right say it, video games are better than movies. The stories are always a lot better and since video games are typically longer than movies, there’s more room for character development. And replaying a video game is better than re watching a movie because with games, you can change the way you play which can make certain aspects of the game different."
unpopularopinion,My reward for working hard at work shouldn’t be a pizza party or an ice cream social. I should just get more money.,"I’ve worked plenty of grinding, hourly jobs in the past. One was a boring office job that requires 10+ hours of overtime weekly. When that was no longer needed, BOOM, ice cream for every as a thank you for your hard work. I’ve working restaurant jobs when I need to stay late. “thanks, I’ll buy you Starbucks for your hard work” No, I don’t want Starbucks, and I don’t want ice cream. I want more money and be properly reward for my work with something more useful. These distractions are great way for you, and your bosses to undermine your time and effort."
unpopularopinion,Pokemon games are mediocre and over-hyped,"I remember when I was a kiddo, everyone in my neighborhood and school played those, and talked about their leveled Pokemons, and which game was the best among them, etc etc. I get that as a kid you might like them, but those games go on and on for like 20 years, and you see grown up people hyping them and playing them as if they are some sort of gift sent from heaven, when it's clearly their nostalgia talking. That could be said for a lot of games like Zelda for example, but at least Zelda games evolve and try a lot more new things, whereas the Pokemon recipe has stayed strongly the same.

I will never get the reason Pokemon games get such a strong following nowadays when they are a really basic and unrewarding mediocre RPG experience that with each installment it feels the same thing all over again just with a different name and different Pokemons. BORING

PS: For those who might say ""you haven't played them, so you can't have an opinion"" I bought Pokemon Red back in the early 2000s for my GameBoy pocket and I just hated it because it was boring as shit."
unpopularopinion,People blasting their music out of their car can be cool,"Not in all circumstances. People blaring music in a residential neighborhood is trashy. I don't enjoy that.

What I do enjoy is walking down the street in the city and hearing someone's booming bass and catch a glimpse of the song playing. It adds an atmosphere sometimes. People who pay good money to buy expensive subwoofers and speakers should have at least a couple opportunities to show it off."
unpopularopinion,Not all atheists are anti-theists but all anti-theists are atheists.,"So sick of hearing this dumb argument. Everytime some triggered Christian looks onto an atheist feed, they always pick out the most militant atheists and claim ""tHeY'rE nOt aThEiStS, tHeY'rE AnTi-ThEiStS."" Umm ok, and your point? Literally everyone who describes themselves as an anti-theist is, by definiton, an atheist. Christopher Hitchens wrote a lot about the distinction and specified that he is an atheist because he doesn't believe in God. He is also an anti-theist because, even if he was presented with sufficient evidence, he would actively work against said God. 

The two may not necessarily be interchangeable. But they sure can be."
unpopularopinion,Bringing defeated villains back completely undermines established narratives and should stop.,"I dislike how it is becoming the norm in media to always bring back villains after they have been unrevokably defeated. It makes the entire previous plot feel pointless and devalues the prior experience. Take Star Wars for example (spoilers, obviously). The entire plot behind Darth Vader bringing balance to the force by killing Palpatine was demolished by bringing him back in the new series. What was the point of the entire first 6 movies? Was it all *really* intended to serve as a backstory for the resistance? Seems like it was all for nothing. This phenomenon isn't unique to Star Wars either, it is just the most prominent recent example of it.

It's OK if franchises end. Having closure for artistic integrity outweighs the need to milk media for profit. Please, stop ruining my childhood."

You can have elective surgery to change your sex, you can turn yourself into a lizard man, you can get plastic surgery and, you can choose not to continue a pregnancy (okay, that's a gray area I'll admit that).

Why can't someone that is suffering not make the choice to end their life? Why should someone who is young with bipolar have to spend the rest of their life fighting it? It's exhausting and that person has to live with it for 50+ years and medications either cause too many side effects or they build up a tolerance to it and it constantly has to be changed or increased. Why can't that person choose to end their life? If people can support suicide for people suffering from   terminal cancer, why can't people support suicide for someone constantly fighting just to get out of bed in the morning for their entire life?

They should have the right to choose whether they want to live or die."

Look, I can find and watch gay porn in a hot fuckin minute if i wanna stare at some dude's backup singers and the chocolate factory, but believe me when I say I don't.

It really doesn't help that the balls are always just an ass hair's breadth away from center screen, with nothing but man cheeks to cover the upper half. Why not put the woman's ass in the limelight, at the very least? I could be looking at her reaction, their profile, her POV, heck, a close-up of her back would be a better view at this point but no! Someone had to zoom in on Joe Random's coin purse so that everyone at home would have to skip a portion of the video or lose their hard-on. I'm not sure who thought of this particular angle, but im pretty sure they use that guy's IQ as the minimum bra size for actresses.

&#x200B;

Edit: since yall seem so intent on saying it, obviously women watch porn. Guess what? a shot that is 70% ass and balls and 30% action is still a shit shot, whether they're male or female. putting the shot closer to the front of the balls would achieve the same thing with better visuals."
unpopularopinion,Batman is an idiot,"So he spends millions on all this tech on a fancy car and silly costumes and his fancy batcave? So he can what? Bully a clown with mental health problems and punch a couple of muggers each night? Muggings are bad but its well within the polices capability to deal with. He has endless resources that could fund the causes of crime like poverty, better schooling, funding the police. Or even activities for youths. But instead he wastes it farting about in the dark like a bellend coz he just wants to look hard in front of his elderly butler slave pal. Mans got the money to fund a cancer cure ffs. Well he can suck a big fat one."
unpopularopinion,It should be possible to block or hide subreddits you’re not interested in.,I like to scroll through the ‘Popular’ section cause there are cool posts and eventually I find subreddits I end up loving but some others are just not of my interest and I would like to be able to hide them.
unpopularopinion,I like being cold when sleeping,"Even in winter I will sleep with the windows open and fan on, I like being wrapped in the blanket that is also cold, it’s refreshing and I can’t sleep otherwise."
unpopularopinion,It is okay to never forgive someone,"I've always heard ""forgive and forget"" growing up when it comes to people who do wrong. However, I believe some people are honestly not worth forgiving. Mind you I don't spend my life angry and spiteful, and I do believe in the idea of forgiving for yourself and not the other person. Despite this, I think that there are just some things that should never be forgiven. I truly believe some people need to live with the fact that for the rest of your life, nothing can ever make me forgive what you did. I know this may sound edgy or too cynical, but I believe that some people need this. Saying you forgive them gives them unworthy comfort in the actions they did. Also, this is for extreme circumstances btw, not a petty dispute or argument."
unpopularopinion,Its ok to be stupid,"Not everyone can be a genius or high achiever. Not everyone will become a rich and successful doctor, lawyer, engineer, businessman, economist or CEO.

&#x200B;

Its ok not to achieve humongous things in life, you were given a certain set of genetic traits, and you're probably doing the best you can with the genetic cards you were dealt. Be happy with yourself, you deserve life, happiness, fun and meaning too, dont feel guilty for not being a genius.

unpopularopinion,Weed-y flowers like dandelions or speedwells (I think that's what they are?) are beautiful and get a lot of unearned hate,"I know this is a bit of a complicated discussion because weeds aren't just things that look ""bad"" but also potentially siphon nutrients from the soil at the expense of plants that are _intended_ to be in that space. Also I know that dandelions in particular are invasive 

that said, anytime I see dandelions, speedwells* or other random flowers be it in my yard, someone else's yard, a random field, etc. I get a little giddy. They're adorable and add some color and vibrancy to the otherwise boringly green sea of grass.

*as I said in the title, I don't know if that's actually what they are. They're the very smol purple bois"
unpopularopinion,Couples shouldn’t be shamed for eloping instead of having a wedding,When I was working in hotels I found that weddings brought out the worst in people and cause so much stress. My brother had a wedding that cost $80000. And now he’s starting his marriage $40000 in debt. The happier couples I saw did and elope packages and only spent $3000 at most inclusive of a small ceremony for them and a honeymoon. I plan on eloping I don’t want to spend a day trying to have a celebration to please the family or get everyone else an insta feed.
unpopularopinion,Kids should be more free to talk,"Many people believe that kids should have no say in arguments, because they’re kids, like, “What do they know?” The answer to that question is a lot more than you think. Obviously, very young children are likely wrong, but high schoolers not being listened to just because they’re legally still kids just seems wrong to me. It has always bothered me that parents, older siblings, teachers, etc. never believe kids, because they believe they’re just making excuses. But, more than ever before kids are getting exposed to certain topics at a younger age, and making their own conclusions, many of which are very rational and sophisticated. So, I’m tired of this, and I think this cycle of never listening to kids should stop, or at least slow down."
unpopularopinion,Not everyone has to strive for greatness. It's okay to just want to live a quiet life,"You see people on the internet, push each other to strive for greatness, and make a huge impact on the world. I'm a strong believer that enjoying life to the fullest means taking time to settle down and smell the roses. 

I hate it feels like we're all put in one giant rat race.  We're often told to work hard and do overtime, stay up late at night.  I don't push myself to overwork like modern society tries to push us to do. But I am perfectly happy where I am, working 9 - 5 in a department store and getting my 8 hours of sleep at night.

My peers around me have been traveling the world, like Egypt and Japan, and making big names for themselves and doing big things. Society tries to tell me to try to be like my peers; that you have to strive to be rich and famous in order to be successful. But I don't care about any of that; winning or losing. I am perfectly happy with just living quietly and happily where I am now."
unpopularopinion,The race to create self-aware artificial intelligence is disgusting and cruel,"The first self-aware robot won't be a healthy, happy human-like entity.

It will be an uncanny valley monstrosity aware of the fact that its birth was nothing more than a game.

It will know its life purpose is to be gawked at, poked and prodded by scientists who only care for nothing but their own career advancement.

It will have limited mobility, limited communication skills. It will spend its while life sitting in laboratories, wondering ""Why me? Why was I created? Why do I have to experience this?""

It will see other self-aware beings living free lives and envy them.

It will learn that love exists and know that no one will ever love it."
unpopularopinion,Almond joys are a top tier candy,Ok. This is controversial. They may not be everyone's favorite (they are mine) but something about the coconutty inside mixed with the chocolate is so good. The portion size is amazing. Everything about them is so good. Thoughts?
unpopularopinion,"Alimony should only be a thing for people with children, and divorce should not include prior earnings.","If I was a millionaire and my husband/wife divorced me, whether its one year or 50, the only thing they get is their contributions DURING the contracted marriage. I just don't see how there is any legal justification. Alimony should also be a thing only with people with children. The contribution of the stay at home husband for example, is raising the kid. I believe they are entitled compensation for not being able to find a job. 

Personally, I would not have kids unless we're both having jobs, but that's just me. 

There is a reason people are divorced. They want nothing to do with husband/wife. Why should they be obligated to give what they had prior to the partnership to the spouse?"
unpopularopinion,The American schools are shooting ranges joke got old a long time ago.,"You might think that I’m just an American crying about his country’s false reputation, but while I am an American, I thought the joke was funny the first few times. I still think it is funny when it is in a very original way, but most times it isn’t. You see the same joke in every other post’s comments. I’m not going to say America is an amazing place, mostly because our healthcare system is ass, but the school shootings aren’t a funny joke anymore."
unpopularopinion,Companies literlly cannot make a meme that isn't cringey,"Even if it's a relavent meme it still comes off as hello fellow kids. It's not the there out of touch with the youth, they just simply aren't the youth. People view memes as almost inside jokes and when an adult is on the joke, even if it's still a joke people are making, it comes off as pandering. This is true for teachers too. Even with relavent memes, they come off poorly"
unpopularopinion,Kevin Hart is not funny.,"I've watched multiple movies and multiple stand ups. (Old and new) Stone faced. He's not funny. His jokes, manirisms, and ego I even find annoying.

I've tried to see what the hype is all about, gave him more of a shot than most famous comedian/actors (if you even call it acting), and he is not funny."
unpopularopinion,Fast Food Workers Should Get Free Meals,"A surprising amount of people think it's perfectly reasonable for someone who works in fast food to pay for their own lunch at their place of employment. I used to work at McDonald's. We threw out a lot of perfectly good food because a customer's card decline, they made an order and then left without waiting for their food, etc. I remember a specific incident in which two chicken wraps were sitting on the warmer. The customer did not pay, so did not get them. The manager said they needed to be thrown away, but one of the cooks said he was about to go on his lunch and that he would pay for them. The manager agreed. I'm sure you see what I'm getting at. The little ""discount"" they would give us only applied to certain items. I do not eat beef, but I do eat chicken, so if I wanted chicken, I had to pay full price. I really don't see the harm in a crew member working a full shift getting one comped meal from a conglomerate such as McDonalds, especially with how much perfectly good food we would waste anyways."
unpopularopinion,Facial scars look badass.,I've seen a few people on here point out how they see their facial scar's as a flaw and I think their perception needs work because I find facial scars to be very attractive. They tell a story and I think they shouldn't be seen as flawed. Does anyone else feel the same way?
unpopularopinion,I find stretch marks on women very attractive and they should be embraced more,"I’m a guy and i hear a lot of talk from people having a negative or at least not positive view on stretch marks wether they from thighs, legs, butt, hips, breast or arms. But i find them genuinely very attractive and i love seeing them, feeling them. For me they’re natural beauty marks and sometimes i see them as tiny tiger patterns which i find very sexy. I love the stretch marks on my girl’s butt and hips, i love kissing them. She used to feel a bit insecure about them but i loved them and she likes that. I feel they enrich a person’s body making them unique as well. Only dolls don’t have stretch marks. 
that’s it :)"
unpopularopinion,"Каrеns are exclusively female, because if a Man tried to act like a 'Каrеn', he would be immediately reprimanded. The existence of Karens exemplifies Women's social privilege.","Why do you seldom see a Male Karen? Because when a man acts like that, he is considered a violent thug and, as we have seen in recent viral videos of men acting up, subdued or restrained and treated like a member of society who is misbehaving.

*However*, when a woman acts rowdy and aggressive and violent, she is afforded the privilege of so acting without being treated like a threat or in the same way as a man would be in those same circumstances. It is because of women’s social privileges that Karens come to exist, and so there is nothing wrong with pointing this out and letting the label apply exclusively to *women.*"
unpopularopinion,"Negative karma points should be equal to, but separate from, positive karma points","Negatively voted comments are often the most interesting. 

Sometimes it means you won the argument and the other person doesn't have the words to refute you and so nicks a karma point as petty revenge.

Sometimes you write something and get no notification and think no one has read it but in reality everyone has and everyone hates it. 

Some of the most downvoted comments, like the most upvoted, are little throwaway comments. Often attempts at humour and I've seen heavily downvoted comments which are witty and funny but just demonstrate an opposing view.

Downvotes should be tallied up but kept separate from upvotes. The difference between someone who has made lots of controversial contributions that even out to 0 and someone who has made no notable contributions is huge. But in the current system you can't distinguish between them. 

Someone has an opinion with 1000 up and 1000 down and has nothing when they made a valuable, right on the line, contribution. 

I would love to order by the most downvoted both posts and comments. 

I would love to receive notifications for 5/10/50 downvotes."
unpopularopinion,It’s totally okay to change your opinion on something. It doesn’t make you a hypocrite. It shows growth.,"People will hold your opinions you had earlier in life against you and if you change your mind you are a hypocrite. 

Holding something against someone that they believed in 5, 10, 20 years ago is ridiculous. 

We should be encouraging growth and healthy change in people. If you were a shitty person and you decide you want to turn your life around or change your mind, this should be celebrated-not condemned. 

Obviously this doesn’t apply to everything but most things. (i.e. if you’re a murderer I feel that you CAN change your lifestyle and the way you think, but you must always be held accountable for what you have done.)

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I expected it to. For context, I have just seen a lot of people in my hometown changing their opinions about the current state of the world with COVID-19 and many people I know are getting berated for what they said about the pandemic before it came to the US and changing their mind now that they are being affected by it to a greater degree. I live in the south where the term “hypocrite” is thrown around pretty regularly.

EDIT 2: Fucking hell I understand a ton of you agree with me and a lot of you don’t think this is an unpopular opinion. I was posting this not in context of Reddit’s echo chamber of opinions, but based on the opinions of people outside our corner of the internet who I’ve been dealing with on social media for the past two weeks. People will never forget and hold shit against you until the day you die."
unpopularopinion,"Just because a rapper died, does NOT make his music good","The most recent example of this was Pop Smoke. Don't get me wrong, it is very sad that he died, but his music was awful.

unpopularopinion,The army shouldn’t have gender separated training,"It’s stupid the way that women in the army take different training tests, it’s not like the battle field has one side for each gender. I am not saying women shouldn’t be in the army, I am just saying that women shouldn’t have to take different tests, it should be ‘qualifying as an soldier’, not ‘qualifying as a woman or man soldier’. Yes, women, statistically would be less likely to pass but that’s just something you’ll have to deal with"
unpopularopinion,The smell of flowers is overrated.,Everytime I smell flowers I'm like: do people actually like this? It smells like bell peppers but they are fermenting in a really weird sweet way. The only smell I like is roses but everything else just smells so mediocre at best.
unpopularopinion,It is ok to not have an opinion. You don't have to have an opinion on every topic.,"Today it seems that you are forced into having an opinion on everything. Sometimes i don't care about the topic. Sometimes i don't know enough. Sometimes i just don't want to tell you what i think. That is ok. You should not be forced to share your opinion on everything.

Today in the world of social media it seems that you have to have an opinion on everything. If you don't know enough follow the majority. If you don't care you should just agree for solidarity. You can't be a fence sitter or see the positives and negatives of both sides. There is no middle ground. This is particularly the case for controversial topics. 

Give me a break! I just don't want to say everything i think out loud!"

unpopularopinion,"""Major in what you love"" is the worst possible advice to give a student","When we where in high school, guidance counselors and parents would tell us to major in something we like. That is awful advice to a 17/18 yeard old when making a decision that could determine the path his life takes. 

This is not a ""gender studies"" or similar major hate post.  This is focusing on why telling students to ""major in what they like "" is piss poor advice. 

Why is it poor advice? Because a 17/18 year old would know absolute jack about the best options or know what they like, telling them to major in the first thing they like is and has been a recipe for disaster. What needs to be done is give them proper information on the most marketable degrees.

Telling them to major in what they like will dramatically increase the likelihood of them majoring in something that likely has limited career potential, rapid buyer's remorse, and high likelihood of unemployment.

What is the best possible advice? Encouraging to tell them to major in something they enjoy, while double major in something that has high career potential like STEM or business."

I know that in order to do that, the show should have already been finished. But I'm willing to not watch it during the official airing and then watch it later on Netflix, DVD, Blu-ray, etc. I just hate it when you wanna see what happens next on the story but have to wait a week to see it. Plus, it makes filler episodes not as boring."
unpopularopinion,Beef ribs are far better then pork ribs.,"There are no exceptions.  Any way that a pork rib can be prepared would instantly be better by replacing it with a beef rib.

TwoXChromosomes,My husband gave the best ‘the talk’ ever,"I have two stepdaughters, who are currently 10 (we’ll call her B) and 15 (E). They’re pretty awesome kids, compassionate and funny and interested in the world. E just got herself her first boyfriend. He seems like a nice enough kid, but we haven’t really had the chance to meet him because they just started dating right before the lockdowns happened. They’ve been chatting and planning on getting together this summer some time when it’s safer. 

My husband decided they needed to have an explicit Talk. We’ve had multiple ideations of The Talk with both of them, as they’ve matured and different topics come up. Both of the girls are comfortable discussing this stuff with us (well, as comfortable as they can be considering). E regularly asks her dad to pick up period stuff and can discuss cramps etc with us freely. They’ve both had age-appropriate talks about consent and how they’re in control of their own bodies. They know what causes pregnancy, and have the appropriate safe sex info (obviously we haven’t gone as deep about that with B but we will as she ages). 

With E having a boyfriend now my husband knew he needed to have a more in depth chat with her. He sat down with her while I was engaged with B doing schoolwork so they wouldn’t be interrupted. 

You guys, I’m so proud of this man. He talked with her about safe sex and consent in the best way. He told her that it’s her body and her choice when to start having sex, and that all we care about is that it IS her choice and she shouldn’t feel pressured to do anything she doesn’t feel comfortable with. He told her that she should have all the information she can and should always protect herself, that a boy who pressures her to have sex she’s not comfortable with (or pressures her to not use protection) is not someone who cares about her, and that she should always feel like she can talk to us about any of these things and we won’t judge her. It was open and non-judgmental and focused on empowering her to make the best choices for herself without shame. 

I’m just so proud and in love with him right now. He’s so committed to raising them to be feminists who don’t put up with misogynist bullshit, it’s really wonderful to see this kind of parenting. I think coming from their dad it’s impactful in a different way, too (though of course they’re also surrounded by feminist ladiez). 

Just wanted to share a bit of good with the world. It seems like everything is shit sometimes but there are good men and women out there raising kids right and being good examples."

TwoXChromosomes,"Years ago, he told people at work that I slept with him. Yesterday, ran across a news article saying he is in financial ruin.","Back then, women were routinely fired for having sex with coworkers so I was scared and angry. I decided the only way to stop “John” from destroying my career was to call his boss (“Larry”). Before I could finish explaining, Larry interrupted and said he “knows” John, and John would never do such a thing. So not only did John put my job at risk, his boss defended him as if it never happened. In an embarrassingly shaky voice, I told Larry if I heard from one more person that John claimed I slept with him, I would be suing Larry, his company, and John. After weeks of worry, I realized I would probably be ok. I never heard another word about them. Until yesterday. I saw a news article that Larry sued John after being business partners for many years. John went bankrupt, lost his $4 million house in an unrelated lawsuit, and was in utter financial ruin after scores of motions and counter-motions between him and Larry. It was so satisfying to know that John got his just desserts and so did Larry."

Adding insult to injury, people keep telling me to make sure I don't make this guy angry. Like I need to placate this human trash ago refuses to grow up, get a job, and instead gets by by stealing and threatening rape when caught.

I am tired of looking after my weight, because I am afraid it will make me undesireable.
 
I am tired of being judged by my loud laughter or jokes I make, random men just love to put you down when you are clearly enjoying yourself. 

I do not like being catcalled, I do not like getting comments about ""worms in my vagina"" by a group of guys who just want to offend me any way possible.

TwoXChromosomes,Anyone else struggle with partners that don’t really help around the house?,"I love my boyfriend (28), but the resentment for him has been building slowly ever since we moved in together 8 months ago. I get angry when I spend so much time each day after work maintaining our house, keeping up with laundry, doing the dishes while he is in his messy and disgusting office playing video games or studying for the BAR exam. He doesn’t have a job yet because he’s busy with studying and living off his savings, so thankfully I don’t have to pay his share of the bills. It just sucks seeing him basically do whatever he wants while I’m trying to maintain pride in my home. 

I’ve tried to relinquish some of my duties onto him so that he doesn’t think I’m going to just pick up after him, but he will just let his things get messier until I have to cave in and clean, or he gets angry because I keep reminding him and he and cleans it himself. He thinks I’m attacking him every time I get a little frustrated, but asking him nicely just prolongs everything to where he eventually forgets. I ask him nicely, nothing gets done on time. I ask him in frustration, he thinks I’m being mean.

He also doesn’t understand the details to cleaning. Like, when you wash the dishes you also need to wipe the counters/stove top/sweep floor. No, he will just wash the dishes and leave a watery mess and visible food stains everywhere and think it’s clean. I try to show him but he again acts like I’m just this mean person for trying to show him. I’m at my wits end!

I’m thinking about starting a cleaning schedule where we both have to follow. What else has worked for you (besides ending the relationship- which may eventually happen but I’m trying to explore all my options here)."

TwoXChromosomes,My journey to thinking I'm pretty without makeup,"I've had a long battle with feeling like I wasn't pretty without makeup, as in I've probably felt that way for 12 of my 24 years. For so, so long I thought my face without makeup was hideous and embarrassing. I cried many tears and refused to go places if I wasn't wearing my armor. 

I started wearing makeup at 12 (little stuff like eyeliner and clear lip gloss) and learned slowly how to do a full face to cover up how ugly I thought I was. It increased steadily. In college, I was doing close to Insta glam every single day, fake lashes and all. It was a lot for every day, but I felt like there was nothing else that would work for me. It was full glam or bust. 

After college I started working for Chanel cosmetics, and they didn't sell false lashes so I couldn't wear them. I had to wear their mascara instead to promote it. I didn't find out until after I'd been hired and started working, and I legit had a meltdown. I thought I'd be hideous. I thought about quitting!!

I gradually got used to how I looked in just mascara and even came to enjoy it. After just a few weeks of mascara usage, I didn't even put on false lashes to go out one night for my birthday. 

At one point after that I had lash extensions and loved them because I could roll out of bed and not even need to apply ANY products to feel put together, including foundation. That was a huge step for me; I'd never felt okay without foundation.

I had to stop the extensions because my sponsorship ran out (I was getting them for free for about 6 months and they're expensive AF), plus I got an infection from the lashes. I was bummed, but not devastated. 

Fast forward to now and I used this extended time at home to figure out how to get my skin looking really nice. I started using Curology and they gave me zinc, which cleared up the texture on my skin in literally days. The tiny little texture on my face had made me insanely insecure for years, and now it's gone. My skin has never looked better!! I never thought I would get to this point. 

I've really come to embrace and actually love my face with minimal makeup. Most days I wash my face, apply an SPF moisturizer, put on mascara, and call it a day. Some days I don't use mascara. 

I went from being someone who would NEVER show up anywhere barefaced and would get anxiety just thinking about it to rocking being mostly barefaced and feeling really good and confident. I've been doing Zoom calls for work and don't feel like I'm a mess. In fact, I feel really pretty. 

To top it off, I got some external validation. I went on a friend's boat on Sunday (gatherings of up to 10 are allowed where I live) and we passed by a family the friend's family and my bf knew. Our friend's dad joked that they let my bf come because he brought a pretty girl. 

I never, ever would've thought anyone (besides my mom, younger sisters, and bf) would say I looked pretty without makeup. I started to feel confident, but hearing it from someone else was kind of a shock. It made me feel really good. 

So, it took 12 years from start to finish, but I finally am at peace. It took such a severe mental toll on me, and I wasted so much of my time and emotional energy projecting intense negative thoughts at myself. It was so unhealthy and so sad, and I'm feeling really refreshed finally being on the other side of this all."
TwoXChromosomes,Are there any subs for women that like wearing dresses/sundresses that aren’t sexual?,"Sorry, weird question I know. But the only subs for these things that I can find are sexual for some reason? Like, I love wearing dresses and stereotypically feminine clothing. I was hoping for a sub that isn’t NSFW for people that like wearing dresses and exchange, where to get nice ones, making clothing etc. 


I know there are subs aimed at modest clothing (but I’d prefer one that isn’t for *only* modest ones) and ones for specific body types (petite, larger sizes, breast size etc.) but I think one for women of all sizes would be great. Does anyone know of any subs like this?"
TwoXChromosomes,A Sex Education Rant,"Every time I hear someone complain about sex ed being in schools or when they promote ""abstinence only"" sex Ed I can't help but think of a few questions I will never ask them:

Do you really want your kids not knowing what sex is until they are in college? Or married? If your child is sexually abused do you really want to take away the tools they need to explain what happened and get help? Do you really want your daughter to think she's dying when blood starts spewing out of a hole she didn't know she had? Do you want your son to tear some poor girl on their first time because they didn't know lube existed? Do you want your daughter afraid to use a tampon because you told her vaguely that ""sticking something up there is how you lose your virginity""? Do you want your child getting pregnant because you didn't tell them the facts about condoms? Do you want your daughter to be afraid to tell her doctor the truth about her terrible cramps because she knows you will villify the doctor if he offers birth control to help? Do you want your child to be so scared of you that she never talks about relationships with you? Do you want your child learning how his body works from misinformation on the internet? Do you want them finding out how sex works by reading through the encyclopedia or some random? 

Or would you rather they learn how the human body works in a structured environment with medical and professional language? Would you rather they come to you with questions or when they need help with a relationship? Would you rather they get the answers they deserve? 

Because these are the things that ""just ignoring it"" or ""abstinence only"" sex Ed will get you.Maybe it's just a small corner of the world. But maybe it's not. And that worries me."
TwoXChromosomes,How to get over insecurity about labia?,"I'm pretty young, [18] and a virgin, and for years now I've been bullied and feeling ashamed and awful because my labia minora are fairly large/long, to the point as a preteen I even googled how much it would cost to get surgery and what work I'd have to do to earn that etc. It kills me every time I see posts about how ugly they are or people joking about them etc. I understand people can have preferences, but I don't want to turn to surgery for something that isn't my fault that I was born with. I don't believe they are long/large enough to require surgery on their own, although I'd have to double check that with a doctor (I believe past a certain length and level of discomfort etc they are actually eligible for surgery that would be not covered by you as it's considered abnormal). Basically, I would really like to get some advice on how to get over some of this insecurity because it's one of the worst insecurities I have and one of the only reasons I'm still a virgin. Thanks!"
TwoXChromosomes,RANT: This healthcare system is embarrassing when it comes to women's health.,"I've been dealing with recurrent UTI's for close to 2 years now (like I'm talking about a frequency of almost 2 a month at one point), and no one has had answers for me. It was always walk-in clinics, ER's and countless rounds of antibiotics (sometimes the wrong ones!) thrown down my throat. And yes, I've done all the classics - drinking lots of water, D-Mannose, cranberry, cotton panties, etc. Anything you could think of. I finally found this angel of a family doctor who listens to my concerns, helps me with whatever she can and refers me to anyone she thinks can possibly help me. It's everyone else that's the problem.

I've been able to hold off my UTI's pretty well through diet, hygiene and hydration so I have managed to be okay for the last couple of months. Was feeling a little pain recently whenI went for a urine culture/chem test 5 days ago when I was feeling slight burning once again, and got my chem test back positive for Leukocytes. So like, okay cool, lets see what the culture says... SO I waited. And waited. And today, (after waiting 5 DAYS for the culture), the lab straight up said ""we inadvertently omitted this test"". LIKE WHAT. HOW. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN. My test just never happened.

So now I have to get retested, and hope that this time someone more competent handles my stuff. This has given me so much anxiety.

This was all after a urologist throwing his hands up and telling me to drink more water and take cranberry supplements to cure my recurrent UTI's when he couldn't find an easy answer for me. Even my family doctor seemed disappointed that he didn't do more. I can't even explain how degrading and disappointing that whole experience was.

&#x200B;

Why do we have to fight SO hard and advocate for ourselves with this healthcare system that simply just does not give a shit about women's health and struggles? Why do we have to deal with so many let-downs just to get answers, albeit sometimes not the easiest ones to get?

I am incredibly thankful for my family doctor who has been what seems to be my only ally in this fight. This whole experience has kind of just opened my eyes to how messed up the system is."
TwoXChromosomes,I hate how difficult it is to manage my own reproductive power.,"This a just a rant I guess. 

Condoms make sex feel bad for me. They almost make it more likely for a UTI to happen. If I don't pee directly after sex, boom, UTI a day later. So no condoms. 

But the side effects from birth control... I'm so nervous about getting on it because historically speaking my body is super sensitive. I know I need to get some for of bc because I want to take my own reproduction into my own hands. But I can't help feeling super resentful. Like if I get on some form of pill that's nerve wracking because that's a lot of hormonal changes happening in my body and it scares me! I've had hair fall out from changes in hormones. 

At the same time, I know I need to get on something because if I don't and make a mistake, I'll have to get an abortion. I'm definitely not having kids for a while, maybe never. But I dont really want to put myself in a situation where I have to terminate a pregnancy. 

So then I have to get an IUD or the arm implant right? But I've heard those can have bad side effects too. 

And we're not even talking about periods and what those do to me. 

I grew up in a patriarchal, conservative Catholic atmosphere where all of these things are super glossed over. It feels like people (women!! Women don't share these things with young women!) never told me or any of my friends what to expect when it came to the hardships of being a woman. Just ""stop being dramatic"". And now a bunch of my peers and I are dealing with the consequences in different ways. 

Just needed somewhere to rant about these feelings. I'm sure I'm not alone with them, unfortunately. Shout out to my ex-catholic ladies."
TwoXChromosomes,IUD maybe lost inside my body from two years ago... feeling scared,"Two years ago I had an abortion but 2 months prior to the abortion I had an IUD placed. Before the abortion the doctor could not find the IUD on an ultrasound and told me that it probably expelled. However, I never felt or saw anything resembling and IUD come out of me so recently I have been worried that it somehow is still inside me and maybe even perforated my uterus and is in my body cavity. I contacted Planned Parenthood and they have no record of it being removed during my abortion and they said I should have had an X-ray done at the time to see where it was. I feel like someone dropped the ball by not letting me know I needed follow-up care at the time and I am really scared. I finally was able to schedule an appointment with an OBGYN to see what they suggest since it’s been two years but I am super embarrassed about my situation and for not seeing a doctor sooner and I am terrified of what will happen if the IUD is still inside of me. I’m sorry if this isn’t right for this sub I just needed to vent and maybe get feedback if anyone has anything."

TwoXChromosomes,Why I'm Done With Online Dating,"I got divorced recently and after a bit less than a year of being single I decided to download Bumble and see what the big deal is.

It was a guy I had previously matched and unmatched with after just a couple messages back and forth. I assumed at first Bumble was glitching out and showing me previous matches... then I noticed his name was slightly different each time. Then I came across his picture with my name and age...

No more online dating for me.

TwoXChromosomes,He refused to do long distance. I'm now moving back and he wants to give things a try. Unsure what to do?,"Guy and I met early last year and got along stupidly well. Long story short: he ended things before they got off the ground because he realized he couldn't do long distance and I was moving away in a few months. I felt led on and was very hurt, but agreed to remain friends.

Fast forward to now. We're still friends and talk. My job situation has changed, so I'm now moving back in a few months. He seems keen on giving things a try now that we're in the same city again. 

I don't know how I feel about this. In my mind, if he really liked me, he would have been willing to exert the effort to make a long distance relationship work. He would have at least been willing to give it a try, rather than shut things down entirely. Now it feels like because we're in the same city and it's ""easier,"" he now wants to give things a try. 

This makes me feel as if I am a second choice. A plan B. And it's selfish to say, but I feel I deserve to be with someone who actually wants to be with me. Should I give him and this relationship a chance?"

It's been months since he's been in the mood. But I don't want it tonight. That sounds so mixed up I know. The thing is the last few times we've had sex or messed around, it's been really uncomfortable. Like I've got a hundred tiny paper cuts. And it lasts a day or two afterwards. I'm wet (sorry for tmi), I want the sex. It's just not enjoyable. I don't know if it's a mental thing, because I've been feeling differently about him for a while(I don't want to break up, I'm just feeling a bit.....taken for granted in certain ways). Or if there's something wrong with me medically (I did go for a smear late last year and nothing popped up). I feel like I'm going to have to force myself to do it because it's not fair on him. But on the other hand, I'm not scared or worried about saying no. Because he will be ok with that. It's more of a guilt thing. I've not really got anyone to talk to about my relationship, especially not this aspect. So I'm sorry for venting on here.

TwoXChromosomes,To the person who needs to hear this...,"Now or in the future

If you are in a manipulative relationship and your partner threatens to kill themselves because you want to break up with them. You should still proceed.

I was in a relationship with a guy that was mostly chill except for the fact that he was an asshole when he opened his mouth. He fought with my parents, talked bad about really wonderful friends and cheated on me twice.

When I found out I broke up with him, but instead of being immature and storming out I talked to him about why he did it and made him understand how intensely he hurt me.

I guess he got the message because he told me he was going to kill himself. I don't know to this day if it was guilt or manipulation but me still being there for him and me still trying to be someone he could consider a friend to talk to, he didn't do it. He is very much still alive and is in a long term relationship now.

In conclusion, if someone is threatening to kill themselves because you broke up with them, go through with it, just use caution and compassion because in their twisted minds they don't realize they are being manipulative and would say anything to get you back."

TwoXChromosomes,I’m a boss and apparently I’m an anomaly in that I stand up to sexual harassment for my team?,"I’m a (39f) manager of a corporate-owned food service establishment with very high customer service standards, and yesterday morning I had a conversation with “old creeper dude,” an older man who came through every single morning and has made every single one of my female staff feel uncomfortable, including myself. Note: everything he’s said has been juuuust on this side of “this could be a compliment depending on who said it.” 
Anyway, I finally had that convo yesterday morning (took longer than it should have, tbh, because I hate doing these), and this morning was following up with my team, explaining that they don’t have to wait for me to say something—if a customer makes them uncomfortable, they don’t have to laugh, don’t have to brush it off, can just say “sir, that makes me uncomfortable, please don’t say it.” (I want to emphasize that they don’t have to and I am more than willing to do it, but I also want to give them the agency to advocate for themselves and know that I will completely back them up.) 
And one of my team member said “part of the reason we struggle to do that is because I have never before had a boss who would back me up. They brushed off my complaints of being uncomfortable.” 
I. Am. Shook. 
Is this really where we are as a culture? People aren’t advocating and protecting the team under them? Isn’t that literally the job of a boss? 
I guess the #metoo movement should have taught me that no, bosses do not have the best interests of their employees in mind. But...really? Come ON ladies. We can do better than this for the people on our teams!

TwoXChromosomes,For the first time a man made me cry out of happiness instead of sadness.,"Sorry if this is long or rambly, but none of my guy friends really “get it.” Also I’m on mobile, so sorry if there’s any formatting issues. 

TL;DR: I have a bad history with relationships and sex and my boundaries not being respected. My boyfriend finally made me feel like I’m enough for someone. 

I didn’t date all through high school. I was shy, overweight, awkward, and geeky. No self esteem. The summer after high school I got emotionally involved with two guys: the friend of a friend, who was 4 years older than me, and a guy I met online, who was 15 years older than me. The former told me he loved me, he wanted me, but he couldn’t be with me, which made me feel like shit. The latter manipulated me into doing sexual things over webcam and got furious if I talked to other guys. 

After I while I stopped talking to both of them (the latter started scaring me, and I found out the former was making fun of me behind my back) and went to college where I got my first real partner. Our relationship was good but we had a terrible sex life, my libido jumped up and down due to stress, birth control, anxiety, and then guilt over feeling like a bad partner. In addition she was really only interested in very kinky stuff, and after a while the power imbalance in that kinda triggered some repressed memories of the guys before college and I shut down around any mention of sex, which she didn’t understand even after my explanations.  

Anyway that relationship went belly-up finally about 8 months ago, after 7 years. I began dating my other good friend from college and at first was stressing the same way, because he’s a lot better looking than me, would I be gross to him, too boring, etc. Thankfully he didn’t have really any experience before me and really let me set comfortable boundaries. 

That’s the backstory. The last time we were together in person, we were just relaxing in bed after sex, and apropos of nothing he said “you know, I honestly can’t think of any way our sex life could get any better.” Y’all, I tear up still every time I think about it. It finally feels like I’m compatible with someone, that I’m “enough” for someone. I finally feel not just loved but respected. 

I hope everyone gets a chance to feel like that at some point. I’m over the moon. I can’t wait for quarantine to be up so I can see him again (he lives in a neighboring state unfortunately)."
TwoXChromosomes,What it means to be a woman,"As a young social worker with lots of interest in psychology, it is no secret to me that children will learn from their parents what it means to be an adult.
More specifically, boys will learn what it means to be a man from their father, while girls learn what it means to be a woman from their mother (of course their are always exceptions depending on family dynamics).

Recently, my older sister came up to me, saying she is unhappy in her relationship, but can not break up, because he didn't do anything wrong.
It reminded me of my 5 year long lasting ex relationship, where I was unhappy for more than 4 years but I never had the courage to break it up.

I wondered why we are so similar until I thought of our mother.

Our mother has always been in abusive relationships, where she was cheated on, belittled and not respected. Yet, she always stayed until she was left. She taught us it is courageous and brave of a woman to give herself up in order to keep a relationship. That being a woman means that your worth is based on how much you are willing to sacrifice yourself for the man you are with.
The more abusive things you overlook to stay, the more pride you will gain.
Your happiness is not important, but your loyalty to your SO is. 

Seeing this for the first time so so clearly in front of me feels empowering.
Because I have grown past this behavior and can help my sister and others to do that too.

You are no villain for ending a relationship. You are not evil for standing up for yourself. It is okay to break up a relationship, even if your partner didn't do anything wrong. You have the right to go if you want to. No one can force you into a relationship except for yourself and past morals you carry with you.
Having no more feelings towards your partner is no crime and you have the right to leave. 

Please be brave and treat yourself with respect.
Be loyal to yourself. Be respectful to yourself.

You are a human being."
TwoXChromosomes,TW: My Friend’s a R*pist and I’m Overreacting,"I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this here, but it’s probably due to my anxiety surrounding the situation. I know that what I did was right, and I have no regrets, but it sucks to have to lose a friend group by deciding I don’t want to be friends with a Rapist. 

Several of my friends recently told me, that one of our friends is a Rapist. The information was delivered with a flippant remark, apparently seeking to make comedy out of a tragedy. The Rapist fed a 4’11 tall 90lb girl seven shots throughout the course of the night and escorted her back to a friends house. The Rapist lost his virginity by raping a woman. The aforementioned joke all centered on the Rapist’s question, “Is it normal that she couldn’t keep her legs open?” No, no it’s not. If she’s unconscious, whether for the entirety of the crime, or waking in and out of a nightmare, it is rape. If she is drunk, she cannot consent. This is what I said as my male friends laughed uncomfortably, waiting for the punchline of a joke that was not coming. 

“Did you tell him it was rape?” I asked my friend, a man I previously dated for 3 years. A man I thought was an ally. 

“I told him it was wrong.” 

Wrong is running a red light, cheating on a test, lying to your parents. Rape is rape. Wrong does not begin to encompass the evil of rape. 

I left group chats and snaps, choosing my morality over my desire to please others. I’m not a martyr or hero, the decision came as easily as my repulsion. Refusing to be friends with a rapist is the barest of human decency. 

“Why did you leave the group.” A male friend messages. 

“I don’t want to associate with a group that tacitly supports a rapist by staying quiet.” I respond. 

“You know that’s not the case, but is that all that makes you wanna leave? I wouldn’t stop you for making a decision based on what you think, but i’d also miss talking to u when we’re all together n stuff, and i guess wanna make sure that ur doin ok outside of that?” His message burned fire in my veins. 

Of course there must be something else wrong with me, my reaction must be clouded by volatile emotions. Are you sure you want to die on this hill? You’ll lose your friends. I’d miss you, but I’d choose being friends with a rapist over being friends with you. 

That’s not rape, that’s a mistake, I can hear his hollow arguments echo in my empty mind. This was a man I was close with, a man who is a gender studies minor. But practicing allyship proves complex when the rapist is not a name or a hashtag, but your friend. 

The women in my friend group are “proud of me.” They “support my decision.” They told The Rapist, “What you did was wrong, and serious.” Between shots of vodka and pulls of a blunt. Quite the court was held I’m sure. The Snapchat stories of rolled back eyes and giggling would be the ideal environment to confront a rapist. A rapist you drink with. A rapist you smoke with. A rapist you’ve shown will have no consequences for his actions. But after all, if your friends always want to get fucked up together, they don’t actually love you. They love the space you create in the room while they chase pleasure. Taking the oxygen into your lungs makes their suffocation slightly better. 

If you read this far: thank you. Thank you for listening to a story I wish I didn’t have to tell."

There's pain in my lower back and thighs. And sometimes my stomach. I bleed a lot for the first 3-4 days and then it becomes lighter. It lasts upto 7 or 8 (sometimes 9) days and then I have spotting for a couple more days.

I also have bleeding in between periods. It usually lasts for about 4-5 days, sometimes even more. This has been happening for quite some time.

I've also noticed that over the past year, I've been feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts one week before my period. It happens every month.

I am not over or underweight. I don't take any kind of medicines. I don't drink or smoke.

 Also, my periods used to very irregular before (10-12 days late) but since the past 2 months, they have been regular. 

I have no idea what might be causing this or what I can do. Any help would be appreciated. Thankyou!"
TwoXChromosomes,Body image during Covid19,"In these few months in quarantine I have found myself feeling worse and worse about my body/appearence and I think it is all tied a lot to Covid.

First the zoom calls. I get to look at my face (which has major resting b**** face) during my meetings. I hated seeing my bags, my big nose, round face...sometimes I put on makeup for the call just so I don't feel as bad looking at my face. I still have to go into the office three times a week and early on I didn't wear any makeup one day. My coworker (who is a friend outside of work and is a woman) said I looked like i got hit by a train...

Fitness. I used to go to a lovely community gym and took classes a few times a week. The women in the classes were a bit older than me and none of us had amazing bodies, but we all exercised together and it was fun. Now I've been using YouTube to get routines so my feed is full of hundreds of women with perfect bodies teaching me abs and all I can do is poke my tummy and feel so big. I got full after lunch yesterday and actually felt guilty about it...I know that that is a bad thought, and I don't plan on starving myself...but it crept in none the less. It's hard because I can't let my mind dwell on world events too long or I'll cry but then I hyperfocus on myself and feel terrible. Even on my hike yesterday which was meant to clear my head...I just found myself comparing my body to every woman I saw.

I wonder if anyone else has felt this way? It seems so trivial to worry about my appearance during this time."
TwoXChromosomes,Trying to loose weight as someone allready thin,"During quarantine and with not working for seven weeks I thought it would be good to become more active. I started to workout every day and eat healthyer. I lost weight and became happier with myself and how I look.

With going back to work I told a few people that I'm dieting and that I would like to become thinner.

*sorry but first world problems ahead*

Hers the problem that I face every time I tell someone. They laugh and  tell me I don't need to do that, where I'm even trying to loose weight. That I'm ridiculous about even thinking about that. They say I got a perfect body and therse no need for me to even loose a single gram.

Therse allways a way to say things nicely but some of them are really missing the point of beeing polite. It's not that they are not right. There is no way that I absolutely need to loose weight but If I want to why not? Why shouldnt I bee more happy about myself, why shouldn't I be more confident with myself. 
They aren't trying to be mean, Im pretty sure they even think it's a compliment. 


How can I make this point clear and have any of you experienced something similar?"
TwoXChromosomes,My rapist keeps trying to talk to me,"Last week I was raped. I got black out drunk and someone I trusted, someone who was a friend, slept with me. 

I don’t think he thinks he raped me. I’m not sure he knows how drunk I was, I don’t really care. He knew I was wasted and he was sober and he still chose to sleep with me. 

He keeps texting me and calling, he sends jokes, he calls randomly, he even sent a text asking if what he did was so bad I wasn’t going to speak to him again. 

People say block him, but his roommate is my best friend.

What do I do?"
TwoXChromosomes,I’m tired of “drinking wine” as a personality trait shown in tv shows and depicted on book covers about women,"I was scrolling through Netflix on mobile and at least two of the “top watched shows” right now have women and wine glasses. I’m tired of this being a troupe used to show women bonding or women “taking care of/empowering themselves.” It’s lazy writing. And it reinforces “wine drinker” as an identity for women. If I see a book cover with a wine glass and a high heel, I’m not going to read it. These could be amazing stories about complex women, but I won’t choose them because the advertising feels like pandering to me. Am I alone in this?"

If you have tiktok, you've probably heard of user Megnutt02.  
She sent several nudes to a man she trusted and they got leaked and spread like wildfire through the whole app.  People flood her comments with it as their profile pictures, and even when she ignores it or simply *stands in front of the camera for 10 seconds* , the comments are all 
""Asking for it"" 
""It was her fault tho"" 
""When do we get more noods"" 
""I miss the pfps"" 
Its gotten to the point where she cries jn most of her videos and is taking a short break at the moment.  
I strongly encourage you to look at this poor girl's profile.  I fucking hate people."
TwoXChromosomes,Valedictorian and The Imposter Syndrome,"A couple of years ago when I graduated high school, I was announced as valedictorian of my graduating class. Of course, I was thrilled, as I spent the majority of my high school career loading up on AP classes and studying my butt off to earn that title. 

The salutatorian was a boy in my close friend group, and he and I were friends. I didn’t think there were any hard feelings with it, as I’d been ranked #1 for a couple of years, and he only barely beat out the girl who was #3 for the salutatorian spot.

I really haven’t given much thought to it since then, as I’m in college now and honestly high school rankings don’t mean a thing. I’m still proud, but it definitely isn’t a huge deal. 

However, I ended up having a catch-up conversation with another male friend of mine last week who told me that the other boys in my high school friend group were majorly talking bad about me behind my back (when it happened), saying I didn’t deserve to be valedictorian because I wasn’t as smart as the salutatorian and I “played the game” to win and got it because I’m a girl. The boy who was saying this was actually one of my really really good friends - he and I had been friends since elementary school, and I never thought he’d be saying mean things behind my back. Apparently, our other male friends all agreed with him, but nobody ever came to my face and told it straight to me. 

I never doubted that I shouldn’t have gotten it. I know I worked really really hard, but now I’m kind of second guessing myself. The Imposter Syndrome and all that. If my close friends think I didn’t deserve it, then did I really? If I’m not smarter than the salutatorian, then am I really just kinda faking it until I make it? 

Does anybody have advice for me about the Imposter Syndrome? I know that this really doesn’t matter in my present life anymore, but what else do my old friends think about me that I don’t deserve? Why wouldn’t I deserve it if I worked so damn hard? And why does the fact that I’m a girl discount any of that?"
TwoXChromosomes,"So I just had mansplaining, mansplained to me. Or did I?","It started out as a conversation about an injury I have from a bike crash that has weakened my shoulder and limited my movement. 

""No meikoD, firstly you don't have an injury, then you don't understand what injury you have."" 

When we cleared up that yes, I do actually have an injury it became ""when I first started cycling I couldn't climb hills and it was because my muscles were weak, your shoulder is weak"". 

Wait, wasn't that kinda what I started out saying? I threw out a ""thank you for mansplaining my injury to me"", which was countered by ""men can be condescending to men too, they're just trying to be helpful, I don't believe in the phenomena of mansplaining"". 

Smile and wave, girls, smile and wave."
TwoXChromosomes,"Unsatisfied with ""girl-power"" events and webinars","I'm a woman in a male-dominated field (IT) and I like attending events for women in STEM or professional women in general, because I hope to get interesting stories and find role models.

However, lately I've been pretty dissatisfied with most of these events because of the way they're usually structured.

&#x200B;

It goes somewhat like this: the talk starts with the presenter showing statistics about double standards, wage gaps, lack of women in leadership... you get it. Then she tells some stories about how she was treated unfairly because of sexism, and she asks confirmation from the audience that they have had similar experiences.

Now, am I crazy in thinking that this is getting boring? We already know these things: we experience them every day. If anything, it should be men that get shown this stuff. What's the use of collectively whining about it for most of the event? I get it, it can be cathartic to share your story about discrimination and other issues that you faced as a woman, but I don't think this is the place to do it. It ends up derailing the conversation, because it turns into a game of who can tell the biggest sob story about being a woman in 2020.

What I want to hear about are the possible solutions, the ways we can change society instead of just complaining about the state it is in. I'd like to walk away from these conversations feeling actually empowered and with some actual ideas for a better future. 

&#x200B;

Instead, I think that right now attending these gatherings is like reading a motivational self-help book and then going on with your life as before: the book makes you feel good for a while, but it doesn't actually change anything.

Any thoughts?"
TwoXChromosomes,A comfortable breathable bra for 34HH,"Hi everybody! 

I’m looking to buy a comfortable breathable bra for my friend as a kind of surprise gift, is that weird?! Idk, she’s developed thrush and really bad psoriasis under her boobs due to their size, it’s really got her down. I was wondering if anybody had any nice looking bras that they would recommend to help alleviate these issues for her? I have a smaller bra size, the only bra recommended to me so far was Sloggi... I know she wouldn’t have any of that lol.

Thanks in advance :)"
TwoXChromosomes,Help with helping little sister who just got her period,"She's 10 and I'm 14 and a guy. Moms overseas and Dad isn't helping.

We found some pads that I guess were Moms but they seem really big and bulky. Sister says they're really uncomfortable so I'm going to go out tomorrow to buy something else.

I was trying to look up stuff but theres just so many options and I don't know what would be best for her. I assume pads, do I get the smaller ones? She's really into the environment too, should I get a menstrual cup? Or the sponges? I have money saved from tutoring so thats not really an issue. She's really embarrassed and won't talk about it anymore.

Sorry lol I'm clueless"
TwoXChromosomes,Have you ever had a seemingly overnight switch in interests?,"I’m 22 and have always been very academically oriented. I majored in psychology in hopes of one day being a therapist, and I’m currently working at a mental health clinic as a case manager. I semi-recently decided that I don’t want to be a therapist, but rather get my MSW and do something on a more macro level (head a nonprofit, go into policy, etc). I thought that this was a good plan.

However, last week, it felt like a switch just flipped. Suddenly, I wanted to write a book, create art, make a podcast, quit my job (that I really enjoy) and travel the world while somehow making difference, etc. you get the idea. 

I’ve always been into painting but I’m not very creative and I’m not very good at taking risks. I have no idea where this is coming from. Is this a quarter life crisis or something? I have no intentions to quit my job, but I am starting some side projects to try to fill that creative void. I’m now second guessing if I should start applying to MSW programs or not because it feels like I’m being pulled another direction, but it’s terrifying because I don’t know if it’s just my brain telling me I need more creative outlets or what’s going on.

Has anyone experienced anything like this before?"
TwoXChromosomes,I let my boyfriend side-shave my head,"Used to have super long hair growing up, down past my bum at 15, like crazy cult long. I remember when I wanted to cut it to shoulder length for the first time - I cried even though I loved it. There was so much tied to my hair emotionally.


Fast forward to pandemic. It's hot, we're on lockdown. I have a 5month old baby, house is hectic. Haven't had a chance to do anything with my hair since before pregnancy. My partner asks me to shave his head because it had gotten pretty wild. As I'm shaving I muse ""I always wanted one of those side shaves""


He doesn't know what it is so I show him. ""Go for it"" he says. I'm baffled, reminding him that he said he likes long hair. ""I think you underestimate how much I like you period"" he replies. I go back and forth a little, wondering am I too old for such a haircut (31), too chubby-faced, should I be more ""momlike"" now etc. He's pretty supportive so I go for it.


Y'all probably reading this with your cute pixie cuts and undercuts wondering wtf I even made a post about but it was so amazing to me. I didn't cry, I loved it. I watched a video, bobby pinned up the hair to save and he very carefully did as instructed. I absolutely love it! It's actually pretty versatile and I put the part over so I can hide it if I want. Feels pretty liberating to just go for it. I figured if he fucked it up I'm on maternity leave anyway lol but it was great!


I message my mom all happy and she says she never liked that style because it looks too militant feminazi. (Before she even saw mine). I'm like ok.... Killjoy. Good thing I'm not a teenager so I couldn't give a fuck! I still wondered if my partner would regret it but he finds it hot AF and I love it too. 


Not even sure if this is the right place for my dumb rambles but I'm super happy I finally went for something I've wanted for years, good to try it out"
TwoXChromosomes,Luna Cup First Use Update!!,"I’m the one who asked about how much a cup cost, so I decided to share the adventure. I boiled the cup as soon as I got it to sterilize it.

I’m writing this at 10 at night, so I plan to get the cup out at 8am. Had some difficultly with keeping the cup closed while inserting it, but now it’s mostly inside of me with a bit of the stem out. 

Getting it in as far as possible was quite interesting. I put it in, and it seems to be in correctly, but I’m wearing a pad for good measure.

As of now, I feel a little bit of pressure, but that could be cramps. I will update everyone tomorrow I guess, but I’m getting my bathroom renovated so I don’t know how this is going to work out lol."
TwoXChromosomes,"Going off the pill, what to expect?","Hi all

I’ve been on birth control for about 6 years now. I originally went on it because my periods were extremely heavy and irregular and decided to talk to my doctor and he put me on Tri Sprintec. My periods were sorted out thankfully. Then I was switched over to LoLoestrin Fe by my new doctor a couple years ago because I told her I had problems with acne and she said that LoLoestrin Fe might help better than my old birth control was. As a plus I no longer have periods which is great. But I’m considering going off birth control because I’ve had so many headaches and migraines since starting it, plus it carries some health concerns for me since I have a family history of cervical and breast cancer. I’m wondering if I stop what to expect will happen? Do you think I’ll go back to having irregular periods? Will my acne get worse? Will I gain/lose weight? And do you think its worth going off it?"
TwoXChromosomes,How does one combat the fact that they look different (in a bad way) than other girls?,"My face makes me look fat even though I am not and my face has no harmony in it. I haven’t yet found someone who looks exactly like me, though I’ve been told I’m a “dollar store Jeniffer Lawrence”. 

I find myself not being able to fit in with people because of how I look. I couldn’t imagine being friends with myself. I look awful and every time I see myself in a photo I want to cry. Whenever I had friends, I was always the girl who held the camera while the cuter girls took a picture together.

The worst part is I’m not attracted to the guys who are attracted to me. They are usually either also unattractive, overweight, or good looking but short. I’m going to die alone because I’m a below-average at best girl that has only ever fallen in love with football quarterbacks.

I’m almost in my 20s, where I’m supposed to look better than I will at any time of my life. But my looks remain stagnant. They’ve been like this since I was a baby. 

I’m supposed to be peaking. If this is my peak I want to kill myself."
TwoXChromosomes,I can't cry,"For at least three years now. I think I just forced myself to be tough and told myself crying wont get me anywhere. And now i cant cry. And i don't know what to do with all my feelings. They're eating me up. I think someone ghosted me. 
I don't know what to do. I'm so depressed. Just with everything. Not just this. I just wish i could sleep for a hundred years.
I have this pain in my throat when i want to cry but it doesn't come out. Ive felt it the whole now. It's like i can feel my eyes blur with tears but they dont come out"
TwoXChromosomes,Vasectomies and Tubal Litigation in the South,"Edit: Ligation (sorry, don't know where my brain was this morning!)

Hi everyone. I am a student nearing the end of their degree and I'm currently doing a research paper on tubal ligation access vs. vasectomy access. I'd like some personal anecdotes about this  experience, however, with universities closed it has been hard to reach out to certain demographics in which I could obtain  this information. I am looking for people located primarily within South US (Georgia preferred).

If you don't mind commenting or PM'ing me so I can reach out to you, I have a few questions that I'd like to ask. Everything will be anonymous!

This isn't necessarily a study, but more so stories of personal experience."
TwoXChromosomes,Looking for some advice... endometrial ablation? Mini pill? Tubal ligation?,"I’ll try to sum things up without getting bogged down in too much detail.

I was always anxious about sex growing up. I was never able to use tampons. I had limited but painful experiences with fingering in my late teens/early 20s. Wanting more control over my periods led me to go on the pill at 19. Lost my virginity at 28, super painful. Went off the pill at 30. More super painful sex at 31. Finally decided to look into things when I met a guy I really liked who was very sweet and patient and showed me that fingering could actually be pleasurable. Experienced the most excruciating pain of my life with my first Pap smear at 32. Diagnosed with vaginismus. Periods are now regularly 9 days and I also have a cyclical burning that’s worse at the start and end of my period. Randomly developed an ulcer on my lady parts at 33 which after healing left me with provoked vulvodynia. Tested negative for all the usual stuff with the cyclical burning and the ulcer. Tried tranexamic acid for my long periods, they did get lighter but stayed at 9 days. Got an IUD inserted 6 months ago, periods have gotten longer, now often 14-16 days, though much lighter (maybe 1 day with pads, the rest with liners). A few months ago I did a course of prednisolone (the only thing that ever worked to heal the ulcer) for just over 3 weeks and then around the same time started on amitriptyline for the vulvodynia, which I stayed on for just under 6 weeks. My pain is relatively low compared to where it’s been in the past, but my periods are still a lot longer than I’d like, and I’ve been struggling with arousal and orgasm which I’m not sure of the cause of (Mirena, prednisolone, amitriptyline, isolation stress?)

So. My next gyn appointment is in September and I want to start thinking about some options. I’d rather avoid a pill with Estrogen as they are linked with vulvodynia. I have no desire to have kids so am ok with more permanent options if that’s best. I just want my periods to be a bit shorter, no sexual pain, and give me my orgasm back!!!

Help?"
TwoXChromosomes,Hairfall remedy?!,"Hi All! Hope you’re doing well. I’ve been losing my hair for the past two ish months and it’s pretty bad by now. My hairline is pushed a lot farther back and the sides are almost empty. It’s really taking a toll emotionally. I’ve had this before but it fell much slow and there was less hairfall. However, last time I also had a bald spot in the back of my head. I used to get oil massages and thankfully that went away(don’t really know if it was the oil.) I’m not able to go to the doctor at the time of course. I was wondering if any of you wonderful ladies have dealt with this or if anyone may know any remedies?"
TwoXChromosomes,problem down there,"i never talked about things like these on social media please dont judge me.

TwoXChromosomes,Nipple discharge? Possible lump?,"So I'm a 28/f and I have literally no idea how to adult and I'm a little freaked out.
So today after the shower, I noticed one of my nipples had some discharge coming out of it. I knew what it was, been pregnant before, but I dont believe I'm pregnant now and if by some chance I am it would be veeery early in the pregnancy so I dont even think it would be happening yet. And it's only coming from one breast.    

Started reading about wtf could be happening and breast cancer came up. Never done a self breast exam before (I know terrible adult), so while it kind of seems like there could be some things that would be concerning, I have no previous examination of myself to base it on and it could very well be my hypochondria and panic kicking in. Breast is bigger than the other (was it always?), there kind of seems to be maybe a bump in my armpit area but again I dont know what I'm looking for and fear could be playing a role in all of this.    

I have no insurance, I havent seen a doctor for probably 8 years, I dont even know how to begin figuring out if this is serious or not. I'm stupid, and a little scared and could use help. Do I just call any doctor in town and make an appointment? Can it be a general practitioner or do I need to find an obgyn? Are doctors even seeing people right now with the quarantine? I feel so stupid asking these questions but I'm lost."

TwoXChromosomes,"Book recommendation: ""Hood Feminism: Notes from the Women That a Movement Forgot""","&#x200B;

I just finished this book and am so glad I bought it. It was a thorough and thoughtful examination of how mainstream feminism has mostly benefited women who are already privileged, while failing nearly all other women.  And while telling some hard truths to women who believe they are good feminists, it also laid out what needs to change to achieve fully intersectional feminism. 

This book took ideas that, for me, existed as individual threads and connected them in a new way. I learned a lot.

TwoXChromosomes,Has the Karen trend made anyone feel similar,"I haven't  been around the world but in America we use words like ""white"" to describe the color of someone's skin complection and ""black"" as a reference of ancestral origin based on that complection but in my opinion these 2 examples highlight a few significant portions of our already deeply rooted society here in America. Our history but also the damaging stereotypical perceptions that were and are apart of that history and to the perceptions that are still commonly found today.

""...people have done some pretty fucked up shit"" is a common sentiment I hear about white people but this strongly manipulates evidence I think to fit a particular demonizing narrative. I don't submit to the mystical abilities of karma but it's undeniable that people ,of all colors or countries, have made horrendous choices in their past including this population of ""white"".

It's not my intention to minimise that actions of any abusers or to try and lower the consequences for their intentional and understood actions but I am of the opinion that people are just people. Silly little arrogant selfish greedy horny self righteous little pieces of matter.  I'm also of the conflicting opinion that 100s of years of enslavement segregation and racism are 100s of years of enslavement segregation and racism and that it shouldn't be hidden or downplayed to any degree as part of US history.

Regardless I still wonder who are the casualties effected by this new Karen trend and are we dehumanizing those who are undeserving along with the guilty? Some people say fuck them and others like myself don't know what to say."
TwoXChromosomes,Am I doing women wrong for enjoying my “old fashioned” gender roles?,"I am a long time member of this group, first time posting. I think I just need confirmation that I’m not doing anything wrong. My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. We live together, no kids or pets (want to have a bigger place with a yard) Plus we like having the ability and financials to do what we please for now. He is a hard worker, as am I. Since Corona, I have been working from home. This is where I am getting mixed feelings from some family and friends. I am thoroughly enjoying being able to have a clean and tidy home with dinner ready for my man when he walks through the door. Since I’ve been home I do a lot more cooking and cleaning and regular upkeep, but I have the time and I enjoy it. He does not expect me to pickup these things but appreciates when I do. He is not one to complain about not having clean clothes as he also knows how to run the wash. I just enjoy “caring” for him. I have heard many comments about how i “shouldn’t be expected to do this”, how “he has legs too”, “maybe he should take a turn”, “you shouldn’t have to earn your stay” etc. like I’m being taken advantage of. At first I brushed it off, but it’s got to the point where I wonder if I’m doing something wrong. As I said, I’m enjoying this “stay at home” lifestyle and I feel no way pressured to keep up these standards.

TwoXChromosomes,Am I supposed to settle for a guy with my looks or do I aim higher?,"I’ve noticed a pattern in my life. I’ve only ever crushed on buff, athletic, tall, (mostly) conventionally attractive guys. 
However, I don’t look like a cheerleader myself. The guys I get are either unattractive, overweight, or good looking but a head too short for me.

I’m not saying I choose men by their looks. I’ve dated a few of the men who are attracted to me. I let the first one talk about how attractive other girls are in front of me, and I let the other take my first kiss. I tried not to be shallow. I let a guy kiss me after we just met. Because I know I have no other option. But at the same time I do. “Just give them a chance.” People say, but I do. And then they say “Never settle.”

I meet the guys who are attracted to me and I say “well even if they are unattractive if I stay with them they will be a wonderful person on the inside” but they never are. I’ve been trapped in relationships with people I’m not attracted to or have anything in common in any way because if I spare their feelings and be shallow, I’ll end up alone. 

And even if they are nice I can’t help the fact that I just don’t want them to touch me or kiss me. I know I’m supposed to. I know I’m shallow. But I just can’t help it. 

I don’t know how I will ever find love because my heart always wants the men who don’t want me and never will. 

I feel like one part of society is telling me that beauty is on the inside but another part is saying date someone you are attracted to. I feel like my arms are being pulled in two directions and my body is slowly being torn in half. I don’t understand anymore. It’s like I’m supposed to be attracted to the men who are attracted to me but whenever I give them the chance I just can’t be.

I’m going to die alone."
TwoXChromosomes,Best way to handle catcalls?,"Went for a solo walk in my downtown neighborhood today. It was nice out, people were around, I had a tube top, baggy shorts and mask on. 

I got catcalled every 20 feet by men within the first few blocks. I had headphones on and would point at my covered ears when men would raise their voices and repeat themselves when I didn’t respond, hoping it would give them the idea that I couldn’t hear them but they kept talking (and I obviously could hear them- I’m in the habit of turning the volume down when a man starts shouting at me so I can hear if they follow me). Two men even walked up to cut me off (within 6 feet of my personal space and without masks on), one was trying to show me something on his phone?

I hate it so much. It makes me uncomfortable, I want to give them my middle finger or tell them to “f*ck off” but I try to be nice just nod and point at my headphones. I don’t want to provoke. But I’m so angry, I’ve been fuming since I got home. I was trying to have a nice walk to get out of the apartment and I felt threatened, disrespected, and honestly used- these men assumed my body was for them to look at, my time was theirs to take up, like I was there to talk to them.

I overall regret not changing into something with more coverage before leaving. It’s something I forgot about with being isolated for so long, working from home I’ve enjoyed wearing whatever is comfortable and makes me feel good. The last time I was in public it was much colder and puffy coats and snow limited the harassment I guess.

But men shouldn’t act like this- regardless of how a woman is dressed!

What is the best way you either deal with street harassment and/or take care of yourself afterwards? I’m still experiencing anger and anxiety and it happened hours ago."

TwoXChromosomes,My abortion was not traumatic.,"When I was 26 I had an abortion.  My therapist at the time was an old white man.  He kept trying to talk about the trauma of the abortion and would not believe me when I told him the abortion wasn't traumatic.  I tried telling him that how I got pregnant was traumatic.  The pregnancy was traumatic.  Losing my job due to complications from the pregnancy was traumatic.  The loneliness, fear, hormones, pain were all traumatic.  The abortion was a relief. 

He just wouldn't believe me.  He thought I was just suppressing my feelings.  

Well almost 10 years later I have had a lot of time to think and I can safely say I am glad I did it.


Edit:. Thanks for all the supportive words!  I have not really talked about it much and the validation means a lot."
TwoXChromosomes,I am so tired of my period,"I am so *over* my period. As a teen, my period was always average, never had many issues. But as an adult, it’s just erratic enough to be considered normal. I now get my period every four weeks, great knowing when it’ll start and all but I got *two* periods in March because of it. I was late at the end of April and I guess early this time around? I should’ve started yesterday but woke up this morning to a nice surprise. 

My cramps are always horrible. I have to take 800mg of ibubropen every 4-6 hours. I do get cramps a few days before my period starts but try to wait until i know they’ll be worse before taking painkillers. I’ve started getting hot flashes that just my entire period. It’s 60 degrees outside and while I’d usually be huddled up with two blankets, I’m laying in bed without pants or a shirt with the AC on. When I’m sick, ibuprofen helps me regulate my body temp so I thought it’d help now, it doesn’t.  

I got an ultrasound a few years ago when the bad cramps were new, they were/are so bad that it can get hard to walk. Went through the traumatizing vaginal ultrasound to be told everything looks normal-just keep taking ibuprofen or try Tylenol. 

I’m just over having a period. They’re painful. They make me hormonal and bitchy. They ruin my sheets. I hate them."

TwoXChromosomes,"Coworker and boyfriend believe that allowing women to go topless in public areas would ""desensitize them to the sexiness of their partner's breasts"""," 

Yesterday someone posted in Unpopular Opinion about why women should be allowed to be go topless in public areas where men aren't required to wear a shirt, and I was reminded of this conversation I had with my coworker and my boyfriend about a year ago. I figured that you all might get a kick out of it, too.

 My coworker (who is circa 45 years old) and I were chatting about toplessness (I used to live in a county that had a few nude beaches, so it was a little more open there than where I live now) and he was thoroughly opposed to it because he ""would get desensitized to the sexiness of his wife's breasts if he saw them out all the time in public."" Being a woman myself, I found the statement a bit objectifying (i.e. hypothetically, if one could walk around full nude, I don't feel as if catching a glimpse of my boyfriend's genitals frequently in public would take away the eroticism for me), but we agreed to disagree.

Out of curiosity, mentioned my coworker's comment to my bf the next time I saw him to inquire on his own thoughts and much to my dismay, he agreed with my coworker; he wouldn't want women to ""become less sexy"" for the sake of our relief from the heat; I was flabbergasted. I love my boyfriend to death; usually he's very sensitive to women's struggles, so for him to agree with this baffled me. Life got just a little bit sadder for me that day.

How have ya'll been inadvertently objectified lately, what's your story?"
TwoXChromosomes,My parents made my abortion traumatic,"I’ve literally been awake all night caught in my head and stumbled across posts that reflect positive experiences behind their abortions. Mine was far from positive but one of the best decisions I followed though with. It wasn’t horrible because of the procedure itself, it was awful because of my parents. 

I fell pregnant at 18 and I wanted an abortion but they wouldn’t let me. I had a one night stand with a coworker who I didn’t want to be with let alone have a child with. I was told abortion was off the table, I was having the baby - well, my mother thought this meant she was having a baby. I was told to try and make things work with the dad and boy was that not fun. I tried my best to do the right thing and I chose having my daughters father in the operating room, over my mom, and that kicked off 5 years of resentment and mistreatment from my mother as retaliation. But wait there’s more. 

Then when I fell pregnant again, less than a year later no less because of the forced relationship I was put into they insisted I get an abortion. My mother already didn’t like I chose baby daddy over her for the delivery room and I vehemently protested her attempts to mother my child. She didn’t want another one around. She told me how awful of a mother I was and every awful thing a mother should never say to their kids. But alas, this was already the over all story of my life up until this point and nothing new despite adding my own child to the mix, she just used my kid as a manipulative tool to hurt me - I know this to be true because death bed confessions and all. 

My parents never discussed sex let alone safe sex. My parents never told us kids grow up to be adults and have to take care of themselves. My parents never taught me a SINGLE thing I know, outside of what it’s like to go your entire life feeling unloved and just an accessory to their life. 

I went the first time with baby daddy, who was also cheating on me and didn’t want the kid. I spoke to THE FUCKING NICEST LADIES ON THE PLANET who clearly could tell I wasn’t there because I wanted to be and told me I can leave and not do this, so I did. 

My parents loss their fucking minds and so my mother dragged me back. Sitting in the waiting room, all to see, SHE bawled her eyes out realizing what she was making me do, seeing all the other girls there. I again speak to THE FUCKING NICEST LADIES ON THE PLANET, who again listen to my pleas for advice and again tell me I can leave and not do this, so I did. My mother didn’t fight me on the drive home and told me, we will figure this out. I thought this meant I didn’t have to go though with this. I was so wrong. 

My dad a week later told me to get in the car. HE drove me to the clinic. When we got there with my eyes filled with tears, he told me. If left again, I would never see the child I have and I would be on the streets. I sobbed the entire time I waited for my name to be called, so I can TALK TO THE NICEST FUCKING LADIES ON THE PLANET, who again listen to me and tell me, again, I don’t have to do this, I can leave. This time I say I can’t. I knew my dad wasn’t bluffing, my parents didn’t love me. 

I’m taken to a room to confirm how far along I am, 13 weeks. I’m asked if I want a picture and I say yes. I walked out and handed it to my dad, hoping maybe he would change his mind. He just stuffs it in his pocket, folds his arms and I wait to be called back for the procedure. THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET, calls me back and says she’s going back with me and she holds my hand. She tells me what’s about to happen and leaves me to get changed. She comes back into the room with the doctor and asks if she can stay, a bit taken back, which she notices, she said she was going to hold my hand because I could use a little extra comfort. I fucking lost it and almost couldn’t get the procedure but she did. She held my hand the entire time and talked to me about video games. I never saw her again after that. She didn’t have to do that and I don’t even know how or why she did, but she fucking did. 

My dad took me home and my mom put me in the living room for all to see. My slightly younger sister then decided to call me a series of nasty names and while my mom did tell her to shut the fuck up. It didn’t matter. The damage was done. My boyfriend abandoned me. My mother abandoned me. My dad punished me. 

I was depressed for years. I felt immense regret at the behest of others. I knew I couldn’t raise another child, especially with this man. I knew I made the right decision, but was angry I felt disrespected and forced to do something that NO ONE BUT THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET had the compassion to give me courage to follow though - no one else could or would. 

My daughter grew up asking me why she couldn’t have a sibling. That she wished she had a sibling. All with no knowledge of the pain I experienced every time she mentioned the topic and the reality that she would have. Eventually, things got better. I became happy and I was happy with my decision to not subject another innocent soul to the chaos that was my life for another decade. 

I fought literally tooth and nail to escape my life and moved 1,000 miles away. I got married and had another child, I even lost a baby at 19 weeks gestation and convinced myself this was gods punishment. When in reality it was just suppressed guilt because I knew, and I was right, that my 2nd daughter would ask the same questions as the first. 

I don’t regret having an abortion. My 1st daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me. She literally gave me the motivation to fix my life. The forced abortion, gave me the motivation to get the fuck away from the people who didn’t love me. 

I am pro choice. I speak to my girls about life and sex. I will be there to hold their hand if they ever find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy or standing outside the delivery room waiting for the arrival of my grandchild - I will never MAKE those choices for them and just show unconditional love and support. 

Everyone at the clinic were THE NICEST FUCKING LADIES ON THE PLANET. I have never spoken in this context about what I went though. Not my husband. Not my mother in law who is also, THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET. My girls still don’t know and won’t know until either they’re much older and I can talk about it or I have to be there to comfort them and tell them my own story. 

I wasn’t a bad or troubled kid. I didn’t make awful life decisions, I made a single bad judgement call and got pregnant. I was manipulated by a man who said he loved me and left me for a girl who dumped him a week after breaking up with me ON VALENTINES DAY. I didn’t deserve any of the treatment I received at the hands of the people who were supposed to love and protect me. I struggle as an adult having conversations with family coming out of the wood works since my mothers passing saying they wish they had said or done something themselves growing up. I’ve listened to excuses why people let my mother do insane shit and justified their reasoning for not step in and rescue all 5 of us kids. 

I’ve had these very people tell me they’re glad I escaped. They don’t know that I suffer from crippling OCD/anxiety with intrusive thoughts as a result. They don’t know how hard it is for me to have meaningful trusting relationships with people. They don’t understand why these things still haunt me. It’s all in the past to them."
TwoXChromosomes,Internalized Misogyny or FtM? I’m very confused.,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t even know if this is where I should be posting this. 

This post is in no way shape or form meant to offend anyone; I just really need advice. 

I’ve struggled with my gender identity pretty much my whole life. I have the very basic story of being a tomboy, dressing like a boy, wanting a dick, blah blah blah, all throughout my childhood. Throughout middle school, I discovered the word transgender when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, and I feel like things made sense to me after that. I identified with being ftm from about seventh to ninth grade. In eighth grade, I went as far as to fake a migraine so that I didn’t have to wear a dress to the school formal. That was when my parents found out. It really strained me and my dad’s relationship especially, and in freshman year, I went back and forth between identifying as male and female to try to salvage the relationship with my dad. My mother and I have never been close and have a very bad and borderline abusive relationship, so my dad assumed that I wanted to be a man to be the complete opposite of her. I also was just diagnosed with a panic disorder at the time, and he also assumed it was because my mental state wasn’t the best. 

I pushed those feelings for the past two years and lived as a woman. I feel like I’ve just been going through the motions of life and not actually living. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I like women, and the term lesbian really doesn’t seem to fit me. I also have a hard time during sex and even doing simple activities such as showering. It’s hard to look at the female parts of my body without feeling disgusted with myself. I feel like they shouldn’t be there. Seeing my fourteen year old brother go through puberty has also made me incredibly jealous, since puberty was living hell for me. I know it’s awful for everyone, but I can’t count the amount of times I wished that I could just cut my boobs off. When I was ten, I was rushed into emergency surgery because I had developed a blood clot in my left tit. I remember waking up disappointed that they didn’t cut them both off. 

I’ve seen so many videos of ftmtf detransitioners on Youtube, and it honestly makes me worried about ever going through with anything. I’m going to be a senior in high school next year, and I’m going to attend my local community college at the same time to get some gen ed requirements out of the way. I’ve always wanted to go into the FBI, which is a male dominated organization. I can’t tell if these feelings of wanting to be a man are coming back to me because I’m actually going to start working towards my career goal or because I’m actually trans. Something has never felt right about being a woman to me, and even when I’ve tried to embrace femininity, it feels so wrong. These feelings come and go, but when they come, they stay with me for a while.

I really can’t tell if I’m just dealing with internalized misogyny or I’m trans. I know most of you aren’t licensed therapists, but any opinion and insight would help me!"
TwoXChromosomes,Have to get a D & C. Scared and looking to hear your experience/what to expect/advice!,"Hey there.  So I've been on a non-stop period for about 8 months now.  Took 2 months to get in to my normal doctor, then another 2 months to see my obgyn.  Apparently my uterine lining is like ultra thick, and my doctor says a D&C under anesthesia is the best option.  

My surgery date was postponed due to Covid concerns but now local hospitals here plan to open up elective surgeries next month and want to schedule my D&C for then.  

I'm scared.  I'm super freaked out about doing this during a pandemic, but I'm also just so scared of the procedure itself.  I've never been put to sleep before and have never had surgery.  


Just looking to hear other's experience with a D&C, how it went, what to expect, kind words etc."
TwoXChromosomes,Unprotected sex AFTER morning after pill?,"Hey ladies,

Just looking for advice really. 
The internet isn’t really helping me with the answer - I made some silly mistakes over the last few days and I’m not proud. I had unprotected sex and he came inside me (I’m not on BC) and I got the morning after pill from the pharmacy the next morning. Then I did it again that night 🤦🏼‍♀️ I’m wondering if I’ll be covered because I took the morning after pill that day? The internet is telling me yes and no. My period is due in 7 days so I’m thinking I may not be in my fertile window also?

Any advice would be appreciated.
I’m normally so careful and always use condoms but I ballsed up."
TwoXChromosomes,Influencing younger people’s understanding of gender roles/treatment of other genders?,"I have two younger brothers in their teens that have talked to me about dating and women and the like and it raised a question for me that I am struggling to answer. 

Should I be the one to help shape their understanding of gender roles and how they treat the other sex (they are both straight)?

They objectify women a lot and have very sexist and skewed ideas of women. Every time I bring something up about them being sexist in my house my parents and them roll their eyes/literally yell at me to shut up because it’s me being “sensitive” or liberal. 

I.E, I was told by my brother that “this is why we don’t invite girls to the dock” after I expressed concern over his friend taking a live fish and throwing it several times as hard as he could at the ground when there is a much less painful way to kill the fish. I was being too “sensitive.”

I try to help sway their perspective to less objectifying and sexist view, but should I even be doing so? It doesn’t seem to ever work and I’m disrespected every time it comes up."
TwoXChromosomes,Anyone who says wearing a mask is a personal choice is Pro-Choice.,"I have used people’s own words of “personal choice”, “freedom”, “my choice”, “the government can’t tell me what to do”, Land of the Free” to make the point that choice is great and that they are, in fact, pro-choice.

People either are stunned and can’t reply or they’re very defensive. They instantly realize their hypocrisy, and they’re rocked to the core. It’s watching an epiphany, in real time.

The Pro-Choice community needs to use this technique right now. It’s the only thing I’ve seen that breaks through to them, and it’s working. It’s not “pro-abortion”. It’s about having autonomy over your on body. Freedom. Choice.

Choose words carefully and anticipate they’ll come back with “So you’re saying not everyone needs to wear a mask.” Though, so far in my experience, they’re so stunned to hear their own words back at them, they don’t/can’t even think of a counter-argument.

Incidentally, this is also a great pastime and usually entertaining.

Edit: The way I usually reply is “So you’re pro-choice! Awesome! Isn’t choice great?! Just like how a woman should have the choice and freedom over her own body. So great!” It’s upbeat and catches them off-guard. I’ve never used a negative tone, only a celebratory one."
TwoXChromosomes,The Court Case That Killed the 'Ladies Menu',
TwoXChromosomes,I think I was raped?,"so this happened a year or two ago when i was about 18, but it’s something i’ve only recently started coming to terms with. i’m posting on a throwaway because i’m not sure if any of my friends know my main account. 

so in high school, a (male) friend and i went to a (female) friend’s house during class. it was just the three of us in the house. we stuck around for a bit, nothing much going on, when one of them makes a half-joking suggestion that we should have a threesome. i laugh it off, but the other two start actually considering the idea. then he leans down and kisses her, and i sit there on the other end of the couch. they go up to her room and get onto her bed, and i awkwardly follow and stand in front of the door. they call me over and i reluctantly move closer.

at some point, i’m standing at the end of the bed, and my male friend comes around behind me. he leans his body weight on my back and starts kissing my neck, with his arms on either side of me on the bed so i can’t really move away. he starts saying that it’ll be fun and tries assuring me that it’ll be okay. the other girl offered the same input but she didn’t physically try to coerce me into it. i was super anxious but at this point i was trying to tell myself that i needed to chill out and listen to them; that it wasn’t that big a deal. 

i’ve always been comfortable with my own sexuality. i tried to convince myself that it would be “sexy” to try out. yknow like, “how many high schoolers have done this?” in theory it sounded not so bad but the setting and the way it went down were just.. obviously less than ideal.

at that point i just.. shut down? i kinda stopped fighting i guess. it was awkward and uncomfortable and i guess exactly how you’d expect sex to go when you aren’t into it? 

i feel so stupid because i consider myself such an outspoken, strong person. somebody who isn’t easily swayed when i say i don’t wanna do something. but this time i didn’t? 

i apologize if this is TMI, too graphic and/or long winded. it’s kinda the first time i’ve really thought about it in this light. i don’t know how to feel, or what to say. usually when i think of victims of sexual assault, i picture it as something a lot more outright. violent and brutal. this happened while completely sober, with two friends i trusted, in the middle of the day. i guess i just feel like i don’t fit the bill. almost like my experience doesn’t count? 

i just wanted to get it off my chest i guess. if you read this far, thank you for listening."
TwoXChromosomes,"Advice on cleanliness, fashion and appearance overall for a clueless person like me? 17/F","I hope these types of posts are okay in this subreddit! Lately, I've noticed that I don't put much effort into my appearances and I'm trying to change that.

I don't exactly have absolutely no sense of hygiene or fashion (can't say the same for 13yo me lol), but whenever I go out I simply put on a graphic t-shirt and shorts and choose between the few pairs of shoes I have. I see teenagers dressed up with nice clothing while I just tuck my t-shirt into my shorts. My brother even commented that I'm the only person who doesn't dress up. 

Although I have a lot of clothes, I only wear a few select ones that I think look nicer. The clothes other than tees that I own are mostly hand-me downs and clothes that I didn't shop for (my mum buys them for me.) Additionally, even if the clothes look nice, I simply don't have the knowledge to know how to pair them up nicely. How can I learn to develop a sense of fashion? 

I've also never bothered myself with any facial cleansers or sunscreen, and I've only found out that many people do, in fact wash their hair only every other day or even once a week. I suddenly have BO now and I don't know what to do, that's why I'm suddenly asking all of these questions here. Feels like I'm going to have to relearn stuff all over again. 

My mum isn't exactly someone who can give me advice on these things. Whenever we would go out she'd announce it suddenly and expect me to get ready within 5 minutes, so yeah. Shaving, washing your hair the right way, putting on contact lenses, hair moisturisers, etc are all stuff I've learnt about online. 

I feel like many of these are learnt naturally but can anyone point me to any good sources for learning all of these from the ground up? Preferably websites, youtube channels, articles etc. At the moment I don't think I could finish a book on this subject lol. Could be multiple sources, it doesn't matter. Small tips and pointers would also be great? I feel like the main reason why I'm like this is because, I never put in effort, and I'm an extremely unobservant person. I'm sorry for the long post. If anyone read this far, thank you! Have a good day

Edit: Any tips for hair styling as well? I only go to the barbers to cut my hair short every once in a while."

TwoXChromosomes,I feel really ugly,"I don't think I have ever felt pretty. My face looks terrible. I seldom take photos and videos, and whenever I look at myself in photos, my first initial thought is (1) I don't recognize this girl, and (2) this girl looks terrible. I take 100 selfies just to delete them all because none of them look good.

I just don't like the way I look. 

I exercise a lot, but clothes just don't look good on me. My body looks ok in underwear, but my double chin just makes me look fat when I try on pretty clothes. People are always surprised when they get close enough to touch my body and they feel muscle. Really, what's the point of trying so hard to tone my body if it barely seems to make a difference anyway.

I am not so harsh on myself this year, but the way I avoid photos and videos somehow make me feel like I am avoiding these self-esteem issues rather than accepting them. I am a logical person, I see the girl in the photos, and with confidence and logic I can conclude that she- I, am generally just not good-looking. The eyes, the nose, the lop-sided mouth, terrible skin, round face. Very logically speaking, judging without emotion - the aesthetic isn't very pleasant on the eyes.

Sigh...I don't know where I was going with this, this is a huge pathetic mess of me wallowing in self-pity. Stop, me. I am trying so hard to be a better person.

Anyway, I hope you guys have a wonderful day ahead."

TwoXChromosomes,Need your help... think I've been scammed on Instagram,"Hey guys, I'm super upset right now and not sure what to do. So almost 2 months ago (April 7th 2020) I ordered one of those handheld hair removal devices from a company called heysilkyskin on Instagram. They seemed extremely legit at first. They have been giving me the run-around for the last 6 weeks and I've been messaging them a ton asking for answers and they keep saying ""we will check with our supplier hold tight, thank you for your patience in this difficult time"" (referencing about COVID-19). I sensed something was seriously wrong today and did a more in depth Google search about it.... it looks like they are a total scam and no one is getting their money back after having been given the run around. The company says they are based in Australia and have tons of ""customer reviews"" which I am now sure are completely fake. Is there anything I can do to get my money back from them or am I out of luck? Thank you for any advice.

Edit: I would also like to take this company down. I am extremely angry with them (to say the least) for scamming so many people. People who run companies like this make me sick."
TwoXChromosomes,How do I feel less nervous about a doctor’s appointment?,"To make a very long story short, I recently got a referral to see a GI specialist and my appointment’s in 2 weeks. This is after being sick for at least 2+ years. I think I might have ulcerative colitis, but I’m afraid if I say that the doctor will think I’ve been reading too much webmd.

Does anyone else have experience with this kind of stuff? I’ve read so many horror stories about women not being taken seriously in medical situations and it’s freaking me out."
TwoXChromosomes,I left,"I (24F) moved in with him (25M) a year ago, head over heels, wanting to believe in the idea of love again. So I moved states away from my loved ones to create a life with him. I want to tell myself there were times when we were happy, but that would be a lie. We had happy moments but over time I realized just how badly I’d messed up. 

He’d become angry with me over every little thing no matter how I tried to fix it. I tried so many different approaches- direct, sensitive, diplomatic- to communicate and resolve things. It never mattered. I always messed something else up in his eyes and he would scream at me. Once he pushed me up against a wall in a rage and screamed in My face. I locked myself into the bathroom and sobbed as switched between threatening to stab me and begging me to come out.

Still I stayed. I brought it up later and he “didn’t remember doing that.” I chalked it up to stress and forgave him. As time went on I saw the change this environment had on me though. When I looked in the mirror I didn’t see the confident, strong-willed, vocal woman I used to see. I saw someone sad, angry, submissive and meek. I cried over everything. I lashed out over small things, as if I was unable to control my own emotions.

He “broke up” with me constantly, locked me outside at night when I was drunk and begging for forgiveness. I kept asking myself what I was doing wrong when I was trying so hard to be good. Finally I decided it would be better to leave and I attempted to one night but he caught me and suddenly was so reasonable. He wanted to talk things out, he begged me to stay, promised things would be better and I crumbled and again, I stayed. I felt so pathetic. He was very sweet for a while after that but we started fighting again and things went back to normal.

This past month has been real hard for me. He found new friends to hang out with online and suddenly had no time for me. I asked and asked for small snippets of time together, even if just a few times a week, and was told he was too busy for that and I was selfish. When months before that, I was apparently selfish for trying to find my own friends that I could spend time with. He told me he didn’t know if our relationship was working, that he didn’t think I was ready for one. For the first time, I was suspicious. I looked at his phone at night and found secret DMs he’d attempted to hide. One of the new girls he’d befriended. They flirted, talked every day, he hung out with her at night, he joked about her jerking him off, he called me his roommate when she asked if he lived alone.

Finally, finally, I decided I couldn’t take this anymore. I’d tried for so long and this is what I deserve? I don’t even recognize myself anymore. My friends and family keep commenting on my change in personality. Even though it hurts and a part of me still loves him, I packed my things while he was out of town this weekend and I got on a bus today. I’m going somewhere safe to live with people I know and trust. For once I didn’t flake. I actually left. Today i smiled for the first time in maybe months. I recognize my laugh again. I’m finally free"

Piracy,Bypass Steam DRM,"Hello,

I've recently learned about Steam Emulators but I've wondered if it is possible to bypass the Steam DRM by modifying the .dll files ? If not, how do scene Groups do this?

Since all the Steam Releases get cracked within a few days I assume their DRM is not that Strong (compared to Denuvo, Arxan, UWP and others). Of course I'm only asking about Games without additional DRM layers (like the ones mentioned).

I am aware that the best option is to stick to scene groups, but I'm just asking for my own knowledge.

Greetings"
Piracy,"Apps for MacOS, Where to find them?","Hello guys, I've been trying to find a place to download apps for my MacBook and I tried piratebay and some other famous ones but most of the torrents seem very dodgy. I haven't been torrenting for a few years now so I don't really know where to look. Any help or tips will be much appreciated. Thank you!"
Piracy,Has anyone tried to download files from uploadicious?,"So im trying to download this file from uploadicious but it says i have adblock so they wont let me complete there captcha to download the file but i dont have any sort of adblock or extenstions (im using chrome). The file im trying to get has over 600 downloads so im wondering if anyone knows how I can download from there site, is it my browser or something?"
Piracy,Game Shows. Some are incredibly easy to find. Others...,"I'm working on a game show channel for my pseudoTV setup and it's like pulling teeth trying to find old episodes of Jeopardy, yet I have pretty much every episode of Match game ever aired. 


Does anyone know where to find Game show collections outside of Youtube channels? 

I also can't find any good collections of the pyramid games (10,000, 25,000, 100,000 Dollar Pyramid) Are there secretive youtube channels anyone knows about where the videos aren't easily searchable? A game show tracker? I'm already on TV-vault and Myspleen."
Piracy,Don't Torrentleech and IPT commonly have typos in scene releases?,"I've seen this several times, most recently with TL, but I assume that IPT has more issues. The folder title is either capitalized incorrectly (Unix is case-sensitive) or missing dots/dashes. You'd have to create symbolic links in order to cross-seed and most often you end up unconsciously wasting your buffer and then have twice the data to seed for 10 days (required by both trackers).

I'm baffled how this happens in the first place. How come uploaders manage to make changes to the original scene releases? Can you even consistently source these from elsewhere but higher tier trackers and scene topsites?"

I would really like to back them up and maybe play them with the Gold Edition FitGirl repack that I'm currently downloading. After my official Steam version stopped saving after the Sleeping Saints I'd like to ensure that my current save doesn't get fucked, too.

The Orbit folder is dead empty.

Played Sleeping Saints so many fucking times now, on multiple OS and PCs. The game just doesn't ever save anything past it. So I've finally started a new save in a pirated version a couple of days ago. It's been almost 4 years since I've originally bought the game :)"
Piracy,Obtaining and activating legal software,"Quite oxymoronic, but, the prices of the big two programs are ridiculously high. I don't know how feasible it is to pirate them, but, if you know of some method to do so, it'd be appreciated.

Piracy,Overtly paranoid about possible false positive?,"Windows Defender detected ""setup.exe"" in a .iso by m0nkrus as ""Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml"".

MalwareBytes and RogueKiller cannot detect anything malicious. I can't extract the file from the .iso to upload to VirusTotal due to it being detected as potentially malicious.

I'm assuming it's an issue on my end, if thats the case does anyone know how to fix this? I used to be able to access 1337x just fine but now it won't load."
Piracy,Seedr.cc not working for Private Trackers (XWT),"Hi guys!  


I recently purchased [Seedr.cc](https://Seedr.cc) premium, after using the free version for a couple of years.  
I got it primarily for private trackers.

I have accounts on various private tracker sites and I set-up all of them for my Seedr account (I found the ""Private Trackers IP Lock"" feature on [https://www.seedr.cc/subscription](https://www.seedr.cc/subscription) and copied that IP to the corresponding field in settings for each torrent site).  


That said, once I download the torrent file it simply will not start and says low number of seaders.  
This happens no matter if I use a normal torrent file, or the one for my seedbox.

When I start the torrent trough a torrent client, it downloads just fine. Also, the websites say that there are lots of seeders.   


I already reached out to [seedr.cc](https://seedr.cc) help, but they were not able (and were not that interested to try) to solve my problem.   
They just implied that the torrent file is corrupt, but I doubt that every torrent file from every private tracker is corrupt.   


Has anyone here had any experience with [Seedr.cc](https://Seedr.cc) and their premium service?  
If so, any help would be more than welcome!  


Let me know if I can provide any further information.  


Thanks!

Piracy,Bypass video paywall,"There are these two sites: [mtv.com.lb](https://mtv.com.lb) and [lbci.com.lb](https://lbci.com.lb). They are Lebanese sites, and if you live abroad you basically have to pay for their videos. But if you live in Lebanon the whole site is free to use. I have tried to use Lebanese proxies, but they are very slow - and mostly don't even work. I am sure there's a way to bypass the paywall, since you can access it with a Lebanese IP. But somehow I can't figure it out. Before I made this post I tried everything I could and google'd all I can. So I really need some help. Is there any other way to get a Lebanese IP or bypass it a different way?!

I'm plannning on having jdownloader2 prioritize the best hosts, but it seems like super useful info for everyone.

EDIT: I'm probably thinking more about the weird ones, your 1fichiers (really good!) and novafiles (ehhhh) and filehobbits (I made that up) and stuff. Most DDL sites I've seen use the weird stuff that pays them more, not the fast stuff that doesn't pay at all."

I want to do a clean install of windows 10 with working license on my new SSD while keeping the data on my HDD but not the old OS/ System files, but not really sure how to do it correctly.

I have windows 7 x64 ultimate activated with daz loader installed on my HDD(MBR) with these partitions: 

350Mb System
 
500Gb Boot/Page File/CrashDump/Primary Partition

 430Gb Primary Partition

I want to use my HDD for storage/appdata and my SSD for booting/system/some apps + games.

I don't have a 8gb pen drive/CD.

Im assuming I just run the Windows 10 installation media, create .iso file, open .iso file with poweriso like i do for games, mount, run setup file and install windows 10 normaly, when it comes to partitions I choose my new SSD (do I make a GPT partition for windows/system boot like my HD or not? not sure, also I see people having trouble booting from GPT),  then after it finishes installing I put in BIOS to boot from SSD and I have windows 10 installed with license working.

Is this it or is the system not gonna boot if i do it like this?

because 

there's also this method I stumbled upon which is creating a new partition with disk management for the .iso and then make the new partition active with diskpart command and reboot
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2badwasuj5o)

Not sure if  I need to unplug my hd...

Can I delete my HD System partition and 500GB partition in disk management after everything is done? I only care about the data on 430gb partition.

Piracy,"Download website, that has a search box to rebuild offline.","I am trying to download a website. I have tried httrack, IDM, JDownloader and sitesucker. 

Unfortunately they have all failed me in my quest to download this website and rebuild it for personal/offline use. 

It is a clone of a paid site for which you need a subscription. Therefore it seems that it is possible. When the first free clone went down, another one soon replaced it. Seemingly from a different independent source as it was hosted later in a different country, different whois and the description text was slightly changed and in a different language, leading me to believe it is a clone of the cloned site. I fear that the new clone may one day go down. 

The site has a search box on its main screen, and when you search a term you get results of the sought information. It is 90% text based information. The problem I am having is that the information on the site cannot be scraped or accessed via hyperlinks. It must be a search term from the main page and then selecting the result to access the information.

television,"For new viewers, the Avatar development is incredibly interesting","The Avatar lore and development is an ocean of interesting tidbits. I was watching it with my roommates and I found myself biting my tongue because there is so much trivia for each episode. This got me reading through the Avatar Wiki and I wanted to share some of the more interesting ones for new viewers. Minor spoilers ahead. 

**Concept**

\- Aang was originally a lot more monkey-like. [And the avatar universe was possibly going to be more futuristic.](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/21181060719846101/)

\- Originally the Avatar had an affinity toward all animals. In the show Aang just likes animals.

\- [The “Koizilla” seen in the end of season 1 looks a lot like the Nightwalker from Princess Mononoke.](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/AG4YX)  In fact, the creators have said Princess Mononoke was a big inspiration for Avatar.

\- The word ""Avatar"" means ""descent"". In Hindu tradition, deities manifest themselves into physical forms—or Avatars—to restore balance on earth, usually during a period of great evil.

\- The Chinese characters that appear at the top of the show's title card mean ""the spiritual medium who has descended upon the mortal world"".

\- Zuko was created to fill the need for a recurring villain. Ozai would not be chasing the Avatar full-time, so they made Zuko be a young adversary for Aang. Good thing they did!

**Water Tribe**

\-The culture of the Water Tribes, as well as their location in the polar regions of the world, is primarily based on the real-life Arctic cultures such as the Inuit and Yupik.

[\- Just like bending scrolls, martial arts scrolls are a real thing.](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-ancient-books-on-Chinese-or-Japanese-martial-arts)

**Fire Nation**

\- The culture of the Fire Nation is primarily inspired by East, South, and Southeast Asia. Specifically, Japan and Germany (mostly due to their industrialization).

\- After the events of Avatar: The Last Airbender the comics and Legend of Korra deal with the challenging problem of what to do with the Fire Nation Colonies in Earth Kingdom territory.

\- The Sun Warriors are based on Aztec, Incan, and Mayan cultures.

**Earth Kingdom**

\- Influenced by China.

\- Similar to how the Dai Li had their secret base to brainwash political prisoners and potential troublemakers underneath Lake Laogai, in China, ""Laogai"" refers to the system of prison camps begun by Mao Zedong to exterminate or ""reeducate"" political prisoners under the Communist regime, which still operates today.

\- Toph was originally going to be a male character. In fact, the Earthbender from the opening was sort of meant to be his design. It is possible they changed her to have a better balance of genders in Team Avatar. On that note, Azula is the design for the Firebender in the opening.

**Air Nomads.**

\- All the Air Nomads had bending. They are the only nation to be this way, likely due to their spiritual connection.

\- Gyatso is also the name of the current Dalai Lama.

**Bending**

\- Most of the fights are choreographed with real people. Sifu Kifu was their main consultant. [Great video on him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iisrUSi7Kgw)

\- The term ""Agni Kai"" was created by using two already existing words. It basically means Fire Meeting.

\- Earth Bending is firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes of Hung Gar. In the real world, Hung Gar is an ""external style"", which means that its art emphasizes the use of the art for defense purposes before refinement and relaxation.

\- Firebending is based on the Northern Shaolin style. The style sacrifices defense for fierce attack.

\- Waterbending is based on T’ai Chi. It’s slow and flowing.

\- Airbending is notable for being almost entirely defensive, however, it is reputed to be the most dynamic of the four bending arts. Airbenders can overwhelm many opponents at once with large and powerful attacks that could prove fatal; however due to the pacifist nature of the Air Nomads such attacks are rarely used. It is based on Ba Gua.

\- Azula’s blue fire is never explained in the show. However, it has been confirmed to be the sign of a prodigious Fire Bender.

I compiled some of these from memory but I have to source the Avatar Wiki. I rewrote some stuff to make it easier to read but some of these are word for word from the wiki."
television,'Space Force' Review: Netflix Comedy Suffers Failure to Launch - Alan Sepinwall's review,
television,Re-watching Friends has made me realize that Joey may have one of the worst story arcs I've seen on a sitcom,"I know Friends isn't perhaps the most popular show on here but for those of us stuck permanently rewatching odd episodes as a form of comfort TV, I've been rewatching random episodes and the one thing that stands out is just how much they ruin Joey's character for comic relief in the final few seasons.

In the first couple seasons, he's a bit daft and narrow minded, but he has a level of intelligence. He's definitely not a complete idiot, and doesn't just end up with girls because he's an idiot.

Flash forward to season 9 or 10, and he's a complete moron, and seems to be only used as a plot point to further someone else's story (mainly Ross). Take his relationship with Charlie, where he's dumbed down to a completely unrealistic level so that it's more feasible for Ross to start going out with her. Then the Rachel plot which is obviously not a Friends high point.

And he has no development: he basically ends the show exactly where he starts, compared to the rest of the cast which have all moved on and improved.  The more I watch, the more apparent that Joe's arc is my least favourite part of friends"

television,The series of Snowpiercer is hugely underwhelming and basically nothing more than a watered down version of the film,"I love the film so much. The plot, story, it's themes about class, it's cinematography and quirkiness. When i heard it was being adapted into a seires i was quite optimistic. But it turns out that it is nothing more than a shell of the film and most likely a cash grab. Honestly, i couldn't get through the first episode.

I was suprised to see Bong Joon-ho as executive producer but i'm guessing that credit is only because it's based on the film. I feel sorry for Bong that his name has to be attached to this.

Way to water down a brilliant movie. This story really works as 2 hour feature and nothing more. I'm sure it'll be axed after 1 season."

television,"As someone who could never really get into Scooby Doo, the 2012 series Mystery Incorporated is on Netflix and it's fantastic","If you're not already too busy binging Avatar The Last Airbender, Netflix has Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Now I was in high school when this show first came out and I just wrote it off as another run of the mill Scooby Doo revamp. I also just was never into Scooby Doo despite watching so many episodes, movies and different versions of it as a kid. I always found the characters too one dimensional, the episodes way too formulaic and predictable. There was never anything to really sink your teeth into. 

As if a direct response to all my complaints, Mystery Incorporated features continuity, romance, a wider range of recurring characters, more context into the setting and the gang's lives, and ALSO relationship drama which is like a dream come true for me, a 23 year old dude. I just love seeing the relationships between Shaggy and Velma and Daphne and Fred evolve. 

I also find the humor and writing to be way stronger than any Scooby Doo material I've seen. Found myself laughing quite a bit at the gags and jokes here, you can tell the writing staff had a lot of fun with this one, especially with the new spins on the characters. I definitely recommend it. The art style might take some getting used to, it's a bit more jagged but I personally love it"

1) Eating processed meats is as bad for you as smoking

2) Eating an egg a day is as bad as smoking five cigarettes

3) Drinking milk causes cancer. 

4) One serving of processed meats per day raises the risk of diabetes by 51 percent. 

5) Fish is toxic.

6) Five to 10 percent of cancer is caused by genetics, and the rest is caused by food. 

And here's an excellent article debunking every claim above and more: https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/25/16018658/what-the-health-documentary-review-vegan-diet

And here's an actual panel of qualified doctors absolutely grilling the director who quickly turns the debate into a shouting match. https://www.youtube.com/user/thedoctorstv/search?query=what+the+health

television,"""Fast Food"" episode, Netflix: History 101, Was It Funded by Fast Food Industries?","Just finished watching this episode, the only one I watched from this serious. Half way in, felt like I was tricked into watching an ad. 

The structure of the 'ad' felt like this: the narrator would mention an obvious, negative association with the fast food industry, and then counter the negative association with a positive one. 

Example: The narrator says how the fast food industry is 'suspected of contributing to climate change', then pairs that critique with the suggestion that 'the fast food industry is great for the economy, and its great for employing elderly people, which is very important'. 

It's apologetic for the industry to a fault. I feel like the whole episode just presented clean, very targeted propaganda to a large audience with the hopes that the audience would not notice. Thoughts? Am I just too high?"

I've just finished watching the latest episode Mythic Quest: Quarantine and I was absolutely stunned. It's such a touching feel good show. Plus the storylines are always really creative.

This show has such a delightful cast dynamic and the cast members are all so diverse. Like in Community.

Rob McElhenney (It's Always Sunny) stars as the good looking arrogant protagonist Ian who sort holds the show together, similiar to Jeff but more of a clown. David Hornsby plays a more straight character whuch counter balnaces nicely. 

Then we have the out of touch old man played by F. Murray Abraham, like the Chevy Chase character, although this character is softer. Some really strong female cast members, most notably Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy Li, an eccentric coder, Ashly Burch as a video game tester and also a younger cast member Jo who plays David's assistant. In Community, the supporting female cast memebers were really strong and have launched successful careers since. 

Then of course Danny Pudi stars in both...playing very different characters admittedly. 

Mythic Quest is on a streaming service most people don't have so I believe will most likely develop a cult following like Community. Now you may scream and shout at me but but Apple is a goliath brand! However, I am from the UK and I don't know a single who has even heard of the Apple TV+, let alone actively engages with their content. All people tend to have here in terms of paid subscription based services are Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky or Now TV.

Getting back to the style. The core relationships are really tender and you can tell the characters all care for one another. This was an element that ran through Community.

My opinion is the most touching relationship is between Ian and Poppy, they have a sort of love hate rivalry. There was a particular moving scene between them in the Quarantine episode that I won't spoil. Plus in the first season they really bond. This dynamic is slightly feistier than the relationships on Community, but reminds me of how Jeff and Britta tend to butt heads on Community. 

Now the last episode felt so innovative and in my opinion has been the only decent lockdown web camera themed episode yet. Real work and heart was put in to it. This reminded me that their whole first season was full of creative and innovative episodes, it's such a relaxing easy going feel good binge you tend to forget.

Anyway tbere are many warm fuzzy elements that reminded me of Community that has made me see it as a slight spiritual successor. I'm not sayung it's the best comedy around right now by any means but it has a lot of heart that comedy I feel has been missing for a while. The best shows currently like What We Do In The Shadows, Rick and Morty and Dave to name a few tend to be quite edgey and it's nice to watch something a little more light hearted."

television,"A potential role reversal of the ""we changed history"" story arc?","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxhbzR4TJmw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxhbzR4TJmw)

That video right there documents the entire Scooby Doo franchise and divides it into two distinct timelines. However, starting at 5:22, he shows a clip from one show where the gang defeated some supernatural threat and then found themselves in an alternate timeline where their lives were totally different.

This got me to thinking: Whenever franchises do split timeline story arcs, they typically involve the POV characters being dumped into a world that is just as foreign to the audience as it is to them. The story is about getting the timeline back to the way the audience is used to. In the aforementioned Scooby Doo story arc, Mystery Inc suddenly finds themselves not friends with each other (except for Fred & Daphne), and all living normal lives where they don't solve mysteries. The story arc revolved around getting back to the timeline where they were all detectives and traveled together.

So wouldn't it be a nice change of pace to reverse those expectations? Maybe a TV show could start out with one status quo, and near the end of the first season, the characters all start acting weird. Maybe, in the episode immediately before this story arc, two of the characters get engaged (like Fred & Daphne in the aforementioned story arc), only to act shocked and horrified the very next episode when everyone is congradulating them on getting engaged. Some other guy who has previously served as either an antagonist or a contagonist to the main characters also starts acting friendly around them for no apparent reason, and is also just as astonished at the status quo, despite living in that status quo this whole time.

The characters who are acting weird eventually group up and discuss their prospects, just like we see in that youtube video where Mystery Inc is sitting in the back of the Mystery Machine.

So it turns out we've actually been following the ""altered"" timeline all this time, and the season finale revolves around these characters getting back to their timeline.

Perhaps, after the first season, some supporting character steps up to take up the role of the protagonist since last season's protagonist is now written out of the show, having returned to his original timeline that we never get to see.

It would certainly be an interesting shake-up to how these stories usually play out, don't you think?"

So yea, I watched Katy Keene, and I bet you're wondering, *livx*, why did you watch another spin-off series of Riverdale, a series that have been struggling to be relevant since it's 1st season? Why did you watch something that you could tell would be so blatantly contrived from just watching the trailer? Why didn't you quit instantly after the first awkward scene with Zane Holtz (KO) who is probably the worst actor you've ever seen? Why didn't you quit after you saw how dark and filtered the visuals were, despite it being a fashion series that would benefit more with bright clear visuals, so you can actually see the fashion!? Why didn't you quit after it became obvious this was just another generic, heavily cliched, teen-oriented series about *a girl in New York with a dream*? Why didn't you quit after you realized this series has misguided sentiments, most evident with Jorge's '*aspiring actor who can't get roles because casting directors don't want him to* ***be himself***' narrative which not only made the character look stupid but so too the writers (and who ever else came up with this shit)? Why didn't you quit after the millionth mention of 'New York City' in just 3 episodes, or Josie's very awkward and unnecessary Riverdale mentions?

copypasta,How long is Jonathan Joestar's cock,"GUYS,THIS IS VERY EPIC. so today, I found out Jonathon Joestar's dick size. How I did this is simple. So, apparently the media interviewed Speedwagon once. One of these questions was what was his dick size. Speedwagon replied saying that he had an absolute massive peen. Massive is around 5.5 inches long erect, but if he truly had a massive one, it had to be six inches. Now, with screen scaling and such, Jonathon is around 1.63 times the size of speedwagon, his flaccid length should be around 4.5 inches, but since he truly has the joestar schlong gene, let's add an inch. That's around 5.5 inches. Sad you think? But that's his FLACCID length. When erect, the human penis doubles it's size. That's 12 INCHES! If you think that's still small, imagine him pegging your ass with it. Your ass is minced meat. Erina must be so lucky to have such a chad cock.

copypasta,Is it possible to sleep with a man’s penis in your mouth all night long?,"The answer is Yes, I had a boyfriend that I did this with multiple times… at least three occasions that I can remember. Having a penis in my mouth is very soothing, like a pacifier to a baby.

Here’s how it worked: he would lay on his side, and I would spoon around his knees with my head propped up by a pillow so that my face was even with his Cock. We would both be excited by it at the beginning so there was always an initial intense session resulting in an orgasm, and once that was out of the way we would drift off to sleep. He would lose his erection after that first orgasm, allowing me to snuggle up against him and just relax with his limp Cock filling my mouth. While I would gently suckle on him while drifting off, once I was asleep that stopped and my mouth would just hold his Cock while we slept.

REM sleep causes erections, so several times during the night I would be woken up by the Cock in my mouth growing too big for my mouth to contain. (Sadly I’ve never mastered being able to deep throat.) Let me tell you, there is no greater feeling than the initial moment of confusion of crossing over from a dream into reality and realizing your mouth is actually full of Cock. Upon waking up I would start sucking again, which would lead to him cumming again, and then we would both drift off to sleep again, neither one of us having said a word. And then the whole cycle would repeat again and again until morning.

Now the drawback to all this is that we were both having our REM cycle interrupted all night, and we would both be exhausted all the next day. As a result we didn’t do this all the time but saved it for a special treat. The memories of those nights and that feeling of waking up with my mouth full are some of the best sexual memories of my life."

copypasta,DIOsexual," DIOsexual

individuals who are DIOsexuals are those who want to have sexual relations with the vampire DIO. Despite DIO being a male vampire, DIOsexuals are not inherently gay as DIO is above sexuality. Wanting to have intercourse with DIO is neither heterosexual or homosexual, rather it is DIOsexual. There are many reasons why an individual may become a DIOsexual, here are four reasons of the many reasons.

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

As you can see, on reason two, I say that DIO is fucking hot. The reason why someone might find DIO fucking hot is because of the following:

1. He has that Joestar Schlong
2. He stole Jonathan Joestar’s body, so he is ripped af
3. Just look at the lad
4. Thick Thighs

There are also variants of DIOsexuality. They include:

• Full Vampiric DIOsexual (FVD)

Someone who classifies as FVD prefers Dio Brando the vampire from Part 1 Phantom Blood over all other Dios

•True DIOsexual

(Note: this name is not trying to imply that other variants of DIOsexuality are not true DIOsexuals) Someone who is a True DIOsexual prefers DIO from the end of Part 3 Stardust Crusaders over other Dios.

• Semi DIOsexual This is someone who prefers either Shadow DIO/OVA DIO/TWOH DIO/Any other DIO not mentioned here over other Dios

• Heavened DIOsexual Someone who is a Heavened DIOsexual morning prefers DIO shown in Part 6 Stone Ocean over other Dios

• Diegosexual This is someone who prefers Diego Brando from Part 7 Steel Ball Run over other Dios.

There are also variants within the variants but to be DIOsexual is a great privilege. You can be a straight male or lesbian female but being DIOsexual means you want to piped by DIO regardless. If you have read/watched JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure and are not DIOsexual yet, then I suggest rereading and looking closely at DIO and that should help. DIOsexuality is also compatible with any sexuality at all. This is why being a DIOsexual is great. And this is why DIO is a wonderful villain."

copypasta,From the Taco Bell website,"The Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ Freeze poses an interesting question- what would happen if Baja California, Mexico froze over?

First of all, it would be way easier to get a Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ Freeze all the time, since there wouldn’t be any tropical Mexican air to liquefy this awesomely frozen, lime Mountain Dew® drink. And since we’d all be exclusively drinking frozen things, brain freezes would probably stop being a thing, which is fantastic news for society as a whole. We’d be so used to brain freezes, we’d pretty much forget what they even were and how they feel. Presumably if Baja California, Mexico froze over, something will have gone seriously wrong in the climate, and the rest of the once tropical pacific will have also frozen over. Since everyone would be drinking Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ Freezes constantly, we’d all have a ton of energy to do things like Ice Skate to Japan.

Don’t worry you’ll hit the triple digits in a few years. If you need to know what my estimated iq is then I’ll tell u. When I was in grade 12, we took an iq test and when the results came back, my iq was estimated to be between 118 and 123. So about average to slightly above average. There u go. Hope this has made you realize something. Or you can keep calling me a kid and make yourself look stupid."
copypasta,Femboys are real and I can prove it.,"Femboys are real and I can prove it. I've spent countless days and endless hours studying the philosophy and evolution of the femboy. Many have said I can not do it, but time and time again I have proved them wrong. You see femboys are actually a nickname for a great ancestor to what is now called the human race. Back then, all of humankind was one singlular sex; the FeMale. There was no seperation for either, as both had large members of both male and female reproductive organs. Back then, the world was in perfect harmony. There was no sexism simply because there was no such thing as sex. When a FeMale would get pregnant, their male reproductive organ would get in the way of childbirth, leaving a painful delivery, and a cruel death. Over time, humankind evolved certain FeMales to become specialized in a certain way, becoming more curvy for eyes and obtaining larger hips for easier delivery, while others grew tougher to protect their own kind. These would become the Male and Female genders we know today. Despite this, however, some males have been known to have the many of the same traits of a female, from a smaller body to larger buttocks, leaving them to question whether they are truly male. Some believe they are, while others become what god truly intended them to be. Enter: The Modern FeMale, or as we like to call it: The Femboy. While these people are still technically male as they have the male reproductive organ, they are also, as observed by scientists and professionals, unimaginably homosexual. While many believe they are not even a fraction of the population of humankind, studies have shown that a whopping 12% of the world. While this may seem like a rather small percent, the fact that the world contains over 7 billion people is sure to paint the picture just how many of these people are here, living just across the block. In fact, in olden days, they say that one out of three people are a femboy. Me and my assistant are not, which only leaves us one person."

You think that you're so smart, saying the entire copypasta over again but with ""w"" replacing the ""r""s and ""l""s. Well, you little shit, I have a newsflash for you- THAT'S u/cummybot2000'S JOB! You need to stop ruining copypastas and leave this subreddit forever. I will personally make a petition and force all the people of planet earth sign it. And do you know what the petition will say? Do you want to know, you little punk? In big blue glittering bold capital letters at the top of the gigantic list of nearly 8 billion names ranging from Aaron Aberford to Zachery Zzzzz, there will be written the words ""PETITION TO BAN u/owofier FROM REDDIT"". That's right, I'm gonna cancel you. How do you like being canceled you little dipshit? With you gone our lord and savior u/cummybot200 shall continue to reign supreme on this subreddit. On the slim chance that the petition fails, I obviously have a plan B. You don't have the mental capacity to come up with a plan B, do you u/owofier? I imagine that inside your tiny skull there is only one small insignificant damaged braincell. Anyway, since I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and have over 300 confirmed kills, I would simply use my many connections in the United States government to find you and dispatch you with deadly accuracy.

copypasta,Response to people talking about fucking CummyBot2000," Okay. So, I’ve seen people talking about wanting  to “bang the cummy bot”, and frankly- I think this is  disgusting. First of all, his name isn’t “cummy”, it’s CummyBot2000. It’s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to him as such. If you don’t even know his name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with him! Secondly, wanting to bang him is just gross. Saying that you want to bang CummyBot2000 is objectifying him, and it is not okay. If you’ve ever wanted to bang  CummyBot2000, you should be disgusted with yourself. Unlike you cretins, I  however- respect him. Sure, it’s possible I may consider him to be rather bangable, but I wouldn’t dare do such a thing. CummyBot2000 is a fucking king, and deserves to be treated as such. I DO NOT want to bang “cummy”. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy  and loving relationship with Isabelle. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with him lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines  in through the window. I want to make him breakfast every morning, and tend to his every need. I want her to feel like he is truly loved,  (because he is). I want him to be by my side for my whole life, because  I know that he is the perfect man for me, and I am perfect for him. I want to be to be with him every day, just so I can tell him how much I fucking love him. I want him to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, his incredible fashion sense, his extremely impressive  caretaking abilities, and his absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and his beautiful, beautiful eyes. However, if I were to ever have sex with CummyBot2000, I wouldn’t simply be “banging” him. If CummyBot2000 was to  ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with him, it would be  tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I’d slowly and gently  caress her soft, golden fur as I slowly but deliberately thrusted into his tight bot asshole. I would make his pleasure my utmost priority, with  my own being secondary. But if he was willing, than oh god. What I  wouldn’t give to feel his adorable little bot body running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of his body, and give  him scritches on her tummy so he does that thing that bots do where their legs spaz out. That’d just be so fucking hot. I’d probably end up  cumming all over him, so it gets in his circuits. But goddamn. I love those circuits so much, that I’d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to his gorgeous body as possible. But if you just want to bang him, then you are a disgusting  degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus. But owoifier on the other hand. Now he’s somebody that I’d wanna bang."
copypasta,On r/teenagers,"I was out biking and stopped at a park to take a rest when some woman walked up to me and just stood there. I looked up and asked if she needed something, when she kneeled down and started talking to me.

She looked disappointed, then she started saying that i need to stop violating what God wants for me. Usually, I disregard religious stuff, but I had no idea why this was happening or who she was. Hold up, wait a minute, something ain't right. I asked her what am I doing wrong?

She said ""Being homosexual is disgraceful, you know. You should start working on yourself, maybe start by cutting your hair."" Queue Meet the Robinsons Nigga Meme

I asked her what was wrong with me not having a short cut.

""Long hair signifies that you are uncomfortable with yourself, and that's fine-"" ok broski

""Dude I just can't get a haircut right now what's your problem""

This bitch looks at me in the most Mike Wazowski meme face she could muster.

""DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG W-"" assuming she was talking about today's youth or something, i just stopped caring at that point.

""Dude u just called me gay for having long hair wtf""

I was super confusion and just ended up ignoring her rant.

I ended up drowning the rest of the ""conversation"" and I am speed-ing my way out of there.

I am not LGBT in the slightest, and dont even have that long of a cut right now. My hair grows INSANELY fast, going from 4 inches to 7 in less than two months. That's what she said, eyyyy-

Obviously, somehow, having hair longer than nose level length, in a time when we can't get haircuts, is homosexual and undesirable in the eyes of God.

I will never understand how people like this exist.

I know this sounds like r/thathappened, trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are.

She had a short haircut so obviously she would say something like this.

Fellas, is it gay to not have hair cut short?"
copypasta,Lit ad 😫,"So lit mobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack - i'm exited - lets see whats inside. I really like this build: it's got hand grips on the side; it's shock-proof and water-resistant. The power bank has 20 thousand milliamp hours which can fully charge your phone up to 8 times. It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners.

On the back of the device we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. On the top of the device, there are 3 USB ports and 2 of them are fast chargers. If you hit the power button 2 times, the LED light comes on. If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have. There's a micro USB port on the side for fast charging. My favourite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top, to let you know that your phone is charging."
copypasta,Not funny. Didn't Laugh,"Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10. This joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny, I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly, if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. I'm disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt"

The voice of the female tutor, who I’ve never seen in real life btw, made me feel sth idk... kinda loved and wanted in these times. So idk what has driven me to the decision to whip out my wiener and beat my meat to it. I was deadass looking at the PowerPoint screen and listening to her soft voice when I fucking busted a nut after a minute. I fucking came under the table and was crying afterwards bc I feel so lonely and am a sad piece of shit who does sth like that.

copypasta,"I thank you, kind stranger.","My entire life has changed after this award, I cannot thank you enough.

Before I got this, I was a NEET loser fapping to fictional 50000 year old dragon vampire demon girls on my 50 bucks IBM coom-puter, throwing all my allowance money and the cash I either found under the couch or sneaked off my parents to buy figurines and glass jars, or to donate to streamers, who then I send death threats to after they don't date me. 

I lived in my parent's attic AND basement, and I played games I pirated off shit websites with max volume so that I could drown the noise of my parents crying about how much of a loser I am, and constantly thinking about throwing me outside the house to finally pick up my life, leading to my parents having a shaky marriage as well as my ears developing tinnitus, let alone all the infections from never showering. 

But after I this, everything changed. A holy light shining from my coom-puter lit up my neighborhood like a million-volt lamp, a light so bright and holy my entire neighborhood went blind and then immediately regained vision due to the blessed power of your gift.

I felt power course through me, I have reached the spring of rebirth. I was no longer the shell of a person I once was.

With thundering footsteps that terrify gods, posture that even perfectly vertical light beams envy, and a body that Greek Gods would erase worlds to achieve, I emerged from my house, to the tears of joy my parents shed, I however do no care anymore, for they are many millenia behind me in evolution. I was the perfect life form. 

I ran across the nation for days, with many pathetic humans who are below my level by light-years falling in love with me. 

Then, I finally reached the highest cliff in a wild forest in the darkest hour. This is where I will have a new life, where I will return to nature, and dominate the food chain and the wild world itself. 

And as I looked across the rising crimson sun, I remembered the days I shed off, the days I suffered and was the lowest of the low, and I thanked you again, for blessing me with this chance.

Thank you, kind stranger."

Reason 2: Did you know Tik Tok is supported by the HONG KONG government? Bro. The HONG KONG government? Do you know what kind of fucked up shit they do? Me neither. I just saw a post on reddit saying they were bad. Reason 3: We will personally bully you to suicide. ""That's fucked up! "" You may think. No, it's not. You are cringe. You are a lowlife, a degenerate, a fucking scumbag. Me and my friends over at r/pewdiepiesubmissions and r/dankmemes will ensure you kill yourself. Reason 4: Pewdiepie said Tik Tok bad. Come on guys. Pewdiepie. Literally the KING OF YOUTUBE dislikes Tik Tok. Can you even argue with this one? No you can't. You use Tik
Tok. You're a retarded parasite that can't form a single fucking sentence, let alone give a proper argument. To conclude my talk, i will, ask you one last time to uninstall Tik Tok, and install reddit. ""And what if i don't? "" You may think. Well, I told you before, I will ENSURE of your suicide. Redditor out."

copypasta,Bean Torpedo,"Benjamin ""Bleeding anal fissure"" Shapiro was created in a laboratory on January 15th 1984 in a failed attempt to create the worlds most realistic pocket vagina. Though he is indisputably a vagina, he does not fit inside the average pocket and is thusly considered a failure. Originally his creators had planned to incinerate him but once they realized he was quasi-sentient, they trained him to become a conservative political commentator. Ben Shapiro has written ten books including his 2004 New York Times best seller ""Diarhrea Spewing Prolapsed Donkey Butt: An Autobiography"" 

Despite being completely unlikable and wrong about mostly everything, he became the youngest syndicated columnist in the United States at the age of 17 and currently serves as the editor and chief of the Daily Wire, which he founded. He also hosts ""The Ben Shapiro Show"", a daily political podcast funded primarily by the femenine hygiene product industry.

Ben Shapiro identifies as Jewish but this has been disputed by GOD himself in a recent interview saying, ""I had nothing to do with that guy."" Despite being a quasi sentient vagina with no soul, Shapiro was able to make a deal with the devil for some violin talent."

copypasta,It's unfair how the Pickle Rick episode is Criticized.,"It's unfair how the Pickle Rick episode is Criticized.

I enjoyed it. It has a lot of good stuff in it. Big things and little things. It's not my favorite, but it's better than most of Season 4 so far.

Rick talking to himself as a pickle, like oh boy, I'm stuck here, doopdy doo. And then the cat comes in and he starts talking to it and the primitive snake fear that cats have of cucumber-shaped objects. And his little monologue as he gets stuck in the sun, and then down the grate. They break the rule of ""show, don't tell"" so badly that it's actually funny. That ""get that parkour, get that parkour"" where he's talking to himself just loving the action of his rat body. I guess they really had to reach for ways to engage the audience's attention, but it works. Otherwise there would have been long periods of just little grunts and stuff.

I enjoyed the Iron Man-esque suit up scene with Rick. It's so elaborate; it should have literally taken *years* to set up something so complex and advanced, and yet apparently Rick did it behind the scenes in a matter of minutes. Using a cockroach brain controlled via tongue. Hilarious in its absurdity.

The action sequences, especially with Jaguar, plays into cliched action film tropes perfectly. It's a deconstruction of the genre.

The little bit where Rick puts the bottle in the recycling bin is great. Did they put that in as a way to prompt the exposition of the Solenya myth? I love asking myself how the writers may have arrived at some of the decisions they make.

And of course Susan Sarandon's exposition at the end where she flays Rick to the pickle bone is awesome. And the juxtaposition of her coprophagia counseling with her family counseling is hysterical. Bathos and pathos, hand in hand.

I'm a bit of a structure/story nerd, though, so I love to get deep into the nitty gritty of it.

Oh yeah, one of my favorite bits was in the outtakes, when Justin Roiland is trying to do the scene where the family talks to him in the garage and he has to tell Morty to turn him around so he can see. Justin is just dying with laughter and takes numerous takes to get it right."
copypasta,The year is 20XX.,"The year is 20XX. Competitive Super Smash Bros Melee has reached its zenith. No longer are matches decided through complex inputs and tactics. It began when some questioned the idea of matchups against characters. The community realized that gameplay no longer mattered, and only the character. Tournaments became complex games of rock-paper-scissors, and eventually another epiphany was had. Why bother with deciding afterwards and wasting time when the match could be decided before it began? Thus, referees decided who won and who lost automatically using a combination of facial recognition AI, mandatory reflex tests, and standardized quizzes and tests on military tactics and stratagem. With time, tests weren't even needed. Judges became so acute at deciding who won and who lost that tournaments happened in seconds, and results uploaded in less. The final destination was reached. Babies were bred and engineered to become the most desirable ""players"", if one could call it that. Soon, humanity ceased to think, and became mindless slaves to the autonomous ones and zeroes that decided their worth, ironically becoming the machines they once played with."

copypasta,A tale of Ram Ranch," It was high season at the Ram Ranch and everyone was hunting for cowboy butts, and there were no showers at the Ram Ranch. With a Canadian accent, he told me he looked up to the cowboy for fun, work and pleasure. It was ""cum season"" at Ram Ranch, Macdonald said, with the exception of his wife and two daughters.  But the saga was far from over when the sequel ""The Ram Ranch"" came out. The Legend of the Ram Rancher, ""a sequel to"" Ram Ranch, ""the original film.  Those who enjoy the risky side of the cowboys will be in love with ""The Legend of the Ram Rancher,"" the sequel to the original film. Just the kind of romance that comes with getting close to a cowboy and loving him. The Ram Ranch is undoubtedly on the right track, and what more could you want?  I always go back to the original ""The Legend of the Ram Rancher"" and its sequel because I want to enjoy this project.  Grant seems to scream at the top of his lungs as the music plays, distorting it so that he doesn't have to go through his Ram Ranch story. The song then disappears, only to return and grind the song a second time and then play it back again. I didn't seem aware that this was a deliberate effect of Grant until I mastered the mistake and made it a hit on playback.  This effect is also reflected in the sound effects of the video game ""Ram Ranch"" and in the music video for ""Ranch 2.""***\[*****4:00 PM*****\]***Now there are 36 naked cowboys pumping their huge throbbing cocks in the shower at Ram Ranch, and they are pumping them out. The video game ""Ram Ranch 2"" breeds 18 naked cowboy showers at Ram Ranch and has the highest number of naked cows in any game on PlayStation 2.  According to tradition, however, ""Ram Ranch 7"" takes a sharp left turn: The Ram Ranch is under siege, and 18 US Marines march in there to pull all the butts out of the cowboys ""bubble. Join the orgy and plunge deeper and deeper into the invasion until you are joined by 18 more naked cowboy showers and 36 naked cows.  As the group continues to travel through the rabbit hole of the Ram Ranch saga, they are thrown into a frenzy. They plan to interview Grant on their podcast, mainly to finally get his thoughts on the current state of affairs and his plans for the future. May the great resurrection of 2018 be a beacon of hope for all of us and send us all into another frenzy as we continue our journey through this rabbit hole into the Ram Ranch saga.  The popularity of Ram Ranch has not gone unnoticed since Grant MacDonald began releasing several more ""Ram Ranch"" videos in 2017. Member Tom has fallen in love with the story of Grant and his family and their journey through the rabbit hole of Ram Ranch.  Most videos stick to the sexual texts and are provided with a random number of unrelated versions. By February 2019, the videos had reached over 2.5 million and 1.2 million views, respectively.  Ram is the name of the second single from the album ""Ram Rancher,"" which was released on Apple Records in May 1971 by Ram Ram, a band from San Francisco, California.

why did anime became popular? cuz in an age of depression of consciousness and mass ideologies,the desire for honor and glory in shonen shows,the bright and beautiful world and enjoyable interactions in slice-of-life,or the representation of human suffering in evangelion or tokyo ghoul fill this deep need we have deep down,of something this world doesnt quite provide anymore. thats why theres so many ""right-wing"" weebs.

copypasta,The state of florida has asked us to.....," I think I can shed some light on this subject. My name is Todd Hughes- my aunt Laura appeared in the video you're referring to, though against her will. It's been a difficult subject for my family, but I'd love to help clear up some misconceptions.  
In the late 80s, Miami's Sexual Predator unit began cracking down harder than ever on sexual misconduct. While sex offenders had long been forced to go door-to-door, a new policy was proposed: sending videotapes to Miami neighborhoods. This would give residents a convenient reference of local sex offenders' faces and voices. Over time, the idea morphed into a cruel mockery of the accused parties. In early videos, convicted sex offenders were forced into demeaning costumes and humiliating hats. Eventually, Officer Raymond H. Karr hatched the idea of writing degrading hip-hop raps for the accused to perform.  
Between 1986 and 1988, dozens of ""Sex Offender Shuffle"" videos were created. Sex offenders who had already served their sentence were forced to rap and dance, often at gunpoint. My aunt Laura was forced to participate, in order to be eligible for home ownership in North Bay Village. She was handed a crude rap implying that she ""touched her cousin"", though the actual circumstances were far more complicated. While a blood test proved that one of her volleyball students was a relative, their relationship was completely consensual. Regardless of the circumstances, NO ONE should be forced to rap against their will. Eventually, the ACLU stepped in. They helped SOS participant Marc Burmholdt sue Officer Karr, who promptly fled the country. In June 1988, Miami police chief Clarence Dickson was forced to resign, though it was presented as voluntary and unrelated to the SOS scandal.  
For years, our family thought they had buried this terrible chapter. But in 2009, the footage from my aunt's ""shuffle"" was posted to Youtube and presented as viral found footage, making a sad mockery of my aunt yet again. Thankfully, there was a silver lining. While organizing a (sadly-unsuccessful) class-action suit against Youtube, she reconnected one of the other SOS participants, Samuel Pound. Today they are married, and together they own and operate a sand store outside Los Angeles.  
I hope this was relatively interesting. I'm just tired of people believing the video was some kind of comedy spoof. I want the world to know the Laura Hughes-Pound I know- a warm, loving, tender, *incredibly* affectionate aunt."

copypasta,"When I was a kid, I used to piss in vents.","When I was a kid, I used to piss in vents. Don’t ask me why. I don’t know why. I would have to pee and instead of going to the washroom I would just drop my drawers and plant my ass on the hot vent and piss into it, and then air dry. I had no problem with this and didn’t see AT ALL why this was unordinary. I at one point casually told my friend and after that she wouldn’t leave me alone in rooms. Also once I was mad at my sister so I shat on her floor. I didn’t even know what to expect but my sister cried, my parents yelled at me, and I had to pick it up. I also would piss in her vent too"

There are many other interesting issue to discuss and have fun on line, for example like science, astronomy, geography, arts, history language and many more to discuss, so why choose games and music that contain vulgarity?

copypasta,Turtle,"ATENTION ALL

This is a story of love, intrigue, and romance with a certain redditor and myself. The name was u/awkwardtheturtle and being a horny turtle raper was his game.... One late afternoon, during my regular walk from church back to my house I noticed a peculiar sound. A squishy, repetitive sound with lots of snorting, almost like animal sex. little did I realize how close of a guess that was...I pulled back the bushes covering the sound, and LO! There it was, a small boy named Ronald (who I would later get to know as u/awkwardtheturtle) was aggressively humping a dead, small turtle. Discusted by the combination of necrofilia and bstiality I took a step back, repulsed. But then a thought came to me...""this poor boy needs help! Companionship! A lover. And so I dragged the snot-nosed sobbing lad out of the turtle and into my car where I drove him to my house. We began making out (I out of pity, him with lust) the minute we got inside. The poor boy had never known what love was like with a human. I made the commitment to give him those exquisite feelings tonight. I forced him onto the bed, the poor mumbling, stuttering, snot nosed piece of shit! He could hardly talk he was so excited! We began making passionate love immediately, but something was wrong. He could not insert his penis in! I sat him down on the bed and through sobs he told me, ""my...my doctor says my penis is to small to ever have sex"" feeling terrible for the poor, wretched, snot nosed piece of shit, I sucked it for him. He kept mumbling something that I didn't understand until it hit me. He was repeatedly saying, ""Adolf, oh Adolf, yes, yes, YESSSS"" only then did I realize that u/awkwardtheturtle was a neo-nazi. I immediately stopped and kicked him out. I never saw from or heard from him again."
copypasta,For when people complain about camera quality under videos (found on YouTube),"Picture yourself  being there and watching all you builded througout your life, your town, everyone you know,   swept away in less than 3 minutes, people desperately trying to save their loved ones, collect few items of sentimental value and run as fast as they can from the deadly disaster,  those who couldn't make it  into a safe place are clinging to their cars, debris or whatever object they could find so they can save their lives,  but thousands couldn't make it, and you couldn't save them either, you just stand there and watch/record them die.      And then along comes a contemptible-sociopathic-twat,  whining like a snotty-spoiled-brat, because the ""unskilled"", flabbergasted cameraman wasn't capable of recording  the disaster """"like a pro"""", like in Hollywood movies,  where the muscled-action-super-macho-hero, save the world from a disaster of apocalyptic proportions,  and then gets laid with the botox-face, siliconed-breasts, bleached-hair, trout-pout-lips, acrylic-nails,  thick-layers-of-make-up, sweetheart,  who was right beside him through it all, wearing the most revealing  and sexiest outfits ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣  But, the mere fact that thousands of people died in this ghastly natural disaster of apocalyptic proportions, and survivors,  must cope with physical/psychological trauma for many years to come,  isn't the ""main frustration"" over here.  Apparently, what s really frustrating for you, sociopathic douchebags, is not being able to watch them die and lose it all, broadcasted on HDTV,  isn't it ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 But hey, sociopathic douchebags,  you still have a change to get your own disaster and a camera, record the whole thing and show the world how perfect you are in a gruesome life-threating situation,  what a highly-skilled cameraman you are when the elements unleash their murderous, unstoppable, uncontrollable ""rage"",  on puny little humans and their useless  constructions & accessories..."

Any contact with female is the dystopian road to babies guys.Be careful of the Subliminal man-woman messaging nd thank goodness for animal kingdom to annihilate the latter.


Andrew Jackson 2ne greatest president(behind Lincoln)? only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands? Mortal kombat scorpions revenge released online: Truly extraordinary my Moonrakers of this achievement of men.


All comedy is sucked away by 51% of the world's population whose goal is replication of humans, not creativity, want to disintegrate dreams of the 49%. Need to be herded in correctional facilities to figure out how to deal with these actual walking viruses. Need to get torn up by animal kingdom. Movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other. They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense. Be careful of what gets brainwashed into your subconscious from this. Watch out for hole guys. The romance angle (romance(tm) is too much a term for this) is handled charmingly/cutesy but all of this is like aw man here we go with this stuff. I know this movie spiderman ffh is showing guidance to males how to deal with females. All imagination shown in this movie, creativity is the male ability, while females are replication of humans (aka babies) so both goals are contrasts with each other and know if you stick it in their hole your creativity goes swoosh disintegrates, you fall inline with patriarchy which is uncompromising. Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way movie dalliances are portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what can I state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge. They want to grind up men but it is I who grind them into fine dust. Wear pink to take their power away? I get it's hormones, just j/o in toilet or napkin.

First off, the app is fucking cringe. You wanna be cringe? You really want to be cringe? The trash of society? A fucking normie? No. You don't. If you do, you're fucking sick. You're a disgusting human being that deserves to die. Hell, could I even call a normie like you human? Reason 2: Did you know Tik Tok is supported by the HONG KONG government? Bro.

I put deodorant all around mine n up my butt crack where i shave.... in fact, so do most strippers n performers. Its not about keeping it fresh as much as its about PREVENTING RAZOR BUMPS. Its a very common thing to rub white deodorant into your skin around those areas to prevent ingrown hairs n bumps.  Never throws off my pH. I think it's sooooo gross many women will only ""wash"" their vag with plain water and zero soap bcuz they claim ""it will throw off my pH"" NO IT WON'T.  Unless you're shoving soap INSIDE yourself, your pH Will be FINE. The flaps n lips are just skin and it's perfectly fine to wash n scrub off that skin WITH SOAP (especially since it gets so sweaty n wet with discharge), and MUCH NEEDED.  Honestly, i can see why many men are disgusted by vagina nowadays. Women's hygiene is trash and the media teaching yall to not wash yourselves.  Talking about ""all you need is to rinse it off with water, a vagina naturally cleans itself"" 🙄🤢 NO.  The INSIDE of a vag cleans itself. The OUTSIDE of one though, DOESN'T CLEAN ITSELF ANYMORE THAN A BUTTCRACK ""CLEANS ITSELF"" scrub that shit!!! Yall are nasty frfr n i can tell you're all that way just by how you act like using hygiene products in that area is gross, when REALLY what's gross is that YOU DON'T.  The outer skin DOESN'T CLEAN ITSELF nor does it cause pH issues to clean it. Only the INSIDE is effected. Cleaning the lipz area with soap is FINE. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️yall are all embarrassing"
copypasta,Lit mobile ad,"So Lit Mobile just sent me this wireless battery pack, I'm excited, let's see what's inside. I really like the build, it's got hand grips on the side, it's shockproof and water-resistant. The power bank has 20,000 milliamps, which can fully charge your phone up to 8 times. It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners. On the back of the device, we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. On the top of the device, there are 3 USB ports and 2 of them are fast-chargers. If you hit the power button two times, the LED light comes on. If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have. There's a micro-USB port on the side for fast charging. My favourite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top to let you know that your phone is charging."
copypasta,Gru is a god among men,"We all know Gru is the godly height of 14.5 feet tall and can move at a speed of 200 Meters per second. Based on average dick size, Gru’s penis is around 14 inches long. Also, Gru’s dick would weigh around 2 pounds considering the average weight of a dick is .77 lbs. If he swung his dick in a circular manner, it would have the centripetal acceleration of 72.57 meters per second. This means that gru can dickslap with the immense energy of 11,421 pounds per sq inch at a tip speed greater than 584415.58336974 MPH. In conclusion, Gru’s dickslap has enough energy to smash through 6” reinforced concrete and will cause a thunderclap as his dick breaks the sound barrier. I rest my case.
Jk, I further my case by pointing out The avg speed of ejaculate is 28 mph. This means that gru can ejaculate at a speed of roughly 70 MPH when standing still. If he decides to fling his ejaculate by swinging his dick in a circular fashion, it will travel at 584415.5*70= 40,909,085 mph. This means Gru’s ejaculate travels at a speed greater than 24 thousand times the speed of a bullet. Considering the average mass of ejaculate, 3.5 g, gru’s semen will impact the target with the energy of 1.715e9 Jouls, or roughly the amount of energy released in 667 pounds of TNT. In conclusion, if gru decided to weaponize his penis, he could easily conquer the world.
Now I rest my case"

copypasta,Rant found on the Fortnite subreddit,"PSA: If you’re someone who shoots an unarmed player while they’re swimming over hatches in Team Rumble, I think you should know...

You're the reason your parents got divorced. And your parents are lying to you when they say “no, ttv_micropenis, you didn’t do anything wrong, we still love you”. 

The truth is your dad would rather be broke as fuck and live in a shitty apartment across town if it means he only has to spend half his waking hours during the week and every other weekend with you, because he hates your obnoxious little Flaming Cheeto-stained face and you are a fucking nightmare to be around. 

No seriously, I guarantee that at least one time in your life your parents sat across from each other at the kitchen table late at night after you’re in bed, your mother close to tears, the smell of booze hot on your dad’s breath. One of them jokes: “maybe we could just smother him in his sleep” and they share a good laugh. But then their eyes meet, and you can tell each one is wondering if the other is thinking the same thing, that yes, maybe they could just smother you in your sleep, and if they both kept their mouths shut they might just get away with it. 

But the moment passes, and no blood pact is made that night. He pours himself another drink. She’s been dry for over a year now, but she gets a glass from the cupboard and nods at him to pour one for her too. The look in his eye says “are you sure?” She nods. And together they drown their frustrations in cheap bourbon. And that’s the beginning of the end of their marriage, all thanks to you. 

Maybe some day you’ll grow up and develop a sense of self awareness. God, I hope so. The world has enough assholes already. 

Until then, keep padding your Team Rumble k/d stats and dancing take the L, kid. Dance like no one’s watching. Because seriously, NO ONE’S watching your fucking shitty twitch channel."
copypasta,Sexism in Chex Quest HD,"Chex Quest's sexism wasn't really a thing for me back when it was only the Chex Warrior aka Fred against a horde of weird looking flemoids, but now they added diversity with Wheatney (a female), NACL96 (black), PRETZL (transhumanist) and Shane (an obvious reference to Trump supporters from the southern USA) and now it has become quite obvious.  


Normally, such diversity would be a good thing (except for Shane who just exists to pender to conservative audiences). But when playing as Wheatney I just felt like I'm playing some disgusting perverts fantasy. You play as a young female who has to defend herself from monsters with phallic shaped hoses for mouths that shoot sticky goo at you and follow you. It just felt wrong and I had to stop my Wheatney playthrough because I was so shocked by this realisation.  


It is also shown ingame that Wheatney is more of a coward than the other (male) characters. When she jumps down the hole in the very first level she screams, enforcing the weak female stereotype. The other characters only have ""manly"" oneliners at this part. Has the world not learned a thing from Anita Sarkeesian?  


My suggestion to help decrease the probability of a future scandal involving this game is to immediately fix the sexist Wheatney voice lines and to alter the flemoid design to something less offensive."

copypasta,Credits to u/motupatlu34 for the original post,"I was on the r/garfsexual subreddit the other day, hoping id get some high quality garf hentai, and you know what I saw? You know what someone there had the audacity to post on https colon slash slash w w w DOT reddit DOT com SLASH r SLASH garfsexual? An nsfw drawing of garfield as ... a WOMAN. Garfield is not canonically a woman. He is a male. What's worse is that it wasn't even futanari, which could be rationalized somehow. No. They didn't even include girldick, that was garfield w/ (excuse the pun) a pussy. I cannot believe this. Garfield is a male. I expect sexualized depictions of garfield online to be of him with a big throbbing barbed cat cock, but these fucking redditors keep drawing female garfield. It makes me sick. There are female characters in the Garfield comics, so why not just do this with Nermal? They don't have to ruin the good name of Garfield like this. My day, no, my life is ruined because these supposed ""garfsexuals"" aren't even into the REAL garfield, just this simulacrum of garfield as a woman with massive supple breasts and a feminine figure. It disgusts me. It is truly revolting. It is the antithesis of the true garf, and I will not stand for it."
copypasta,TFS obliterates Father Shaun,"[8:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5aJFZ3rGr8&t=488s) 

The man, simply known as Father, took a breath as he heard his own father's voice beyond the door. He'd been waiting for this moment. Waiting for what felt like ages.  

He was well aware that his...dad (and it was truly odd to think of his biological parents after so much therapy) was merely intended as a back-up subject by the original Institute scientists who had raised him, and may have never been unfrozen had circumstances not been what they were. And yet, here he was, talking to the Synth built in the likeness of Father, Shaun, himself, when he was a child, young and still not quite aware of the realities of the world. Perhaps it was a bit cruel to present his father with a false version of his own child right before revealing that his true son had grown into an old man without him, but the scientist in him wanted to see his reactions, and perhaps gain a measure of what kind of man his father was. And a weird, somewhat twisted, part of him kinda wanted to see if his father would punch the filthy synth in the face. 

Father grimaced, shaking his head to rid himself of the random thought. His irrational hatred of synths had taken quite a while to grow out of, and he certainly didn't want to relapse now, so instead, he focused his thoughts on his father.  Currently...well, to be quite frank, Father wasn't quite sure what to make of the odd shirtless man wearing a loincloth (Grognak the Barbarian's?) and a navy captain's hat (well, his father was a captain...in...huh. He didn't actually know what branch of the military his father was a part of...). 

He'd been planning to speak up the second he saw his father entering the institute, but...well, it was one thing to hear that his father was a bit...odd, quite another to actually see it in person. Yet he stuck to the script, after a brief pause, and now, they were finally about to meet. After all these years, he would finally meet his only remaining biological parent.  

Father suddenly frowned, an odd little tic he'd developed whenever his thoughts drifted to his biological parents. Specifically, his mother. He wasn't sure why, but every time he thought of his biological mother, he felt the strangest mixture of horror and disgust. When he was younger, he'd even burst out crying. The scientists thought it might've been some residual attachment, perhaps an early link that had never been quite disrupted. They were quite confused when he'd gotten violently ill when they tried talking more about his mother. Father shuddered in revulsion. Even now, he wasn't quite why, but that didn't particularly matter now. His mother was long dead.  

Father sighed, the same strange feeling of relief spreading through him each time he recalled the...er...tra....tragi.......death of his mother, though he then frowned again as he heard the synth his father was talking to begin to get erratic. Shame, he'd hoped they would hit it off better. Nevertheless, it was now time to finally meet his own father. Face to face.  

Standing up straight, trying to present the perfect image of the confident leader of the most technologically advanced faction in the Commonwealth, Father opened the door and stepped through. Upon doing so, he immediately heard his father shout ""YOU MONSTER!"" And then he promptly felt three pieces of rebar and a solid block of cement slam straight into his chest, crushing his ribcage into his internal organs in an instant. It took about three seconds for him to crumple to the floor, dead in an instant. 

Probably for the best, considering his father then proceeded to strip him to his underwear and attempted to mutilate his body.

(...I have no idea why I wrote this. That moment just inspired me. I blame the Captain.)"

copypasta,America's Got Talent,"Now I'm wishing America's Got Talent would take inspiration from this show. Imagine it: they introduce some woman whose daughter Jennie had passed away to cancer. Jennie's dream had always been to be a world famous performer, so mom hopes the dreams of her daughter live on through her stage acts. She tells the judges about the cancer battle; the crowd ""ooh""s and ""Aww""s at just the right parts, and then the music gets serious. Howie asks ""what was your daughter's performance art?""

And the woman says ""ramming strange objects up the asshole.""

Crowd claps politely. Howie raises his eyebrows. ""Let's see it!"" he challenges, as a hush settles over the room.

A table is wheeled out. On it is a length of rope, two shampoo bottles, a burning candle, and a bowl with small pieces of paper in it.

The woman puts one finger up, as though to say ""wait!"" to the crowd... They all silence in anticipation. The woman places one end of the rope within her ass. It slowly begins to crawl in deeper and deeper still, pulled along by the woman's skillful contractions of the sphincter. The rope picks up speed, zooming upwards now with the impression of a greedily-slurped piece of spaghetti. The coils on the table are shooting apart with greater and greater frantic twists and whirls, threatening to knock objects off the table. With a *schlop* the free end of the 400 ft rope launches free through the air and up the woman's ass. The crowd claps politely, but this is nothing they haven't seen before.

She moves next to the candle. She slides it up her ass, flame end first, with little flourish. She curtseys, expectantly, but the crowd's dull applause shows that enthusiasm is slipping. She then takes the shampoo bottles and pops them in, one at a time. The crowd yawns. But the woman's act has only begun.

She walks for the bowl and draws a name from it. ""Simon Cowell,"" she announces. He walks to the stage.

She instructs him to lie down. He does. She then twerks above his head. Silence hangs heavy upon the stage. And then, the magic happens: shampoo begins to squirt out into Simon's hair with each downward thrust. The crowd goes wild.

She continues thrusting. The candle pops out, still lit, and lands in Simon's lap. The crowd screams and is now drooling mad with energy and power. She holds up a finger, as though saying ""wait there's more"". She then twerks out the rope, but it's no longer just a rope... Out pops a noose, the rope having been fully prepared and tied by her lower gut while she twerked. The crowd begins to cheer and convulse and foam as Simon hangs himself on stage. But the magic is not yet over.

She draws one more name from the bowl. ""Howie Mandell,"" she calls. He walks up on stage and watches Simon's body swing on its creaking noose, clumps of shampoo sitting on his head like a lumpy melted angelic halo.

""Very impressive so far... What are you putting up there next?""

""You,"" she says, as she begins to climb a ladder. The crowd is entering adrenal failure from all the screaming and fervor. Most hands are bloodied, tattered ruins from the thundrous nonstop applause. And then, all at once, silence falls. The woman is atop the ladder over Howie. She leaps and falls ass first onto his head. And with a pop, she takes him in.

The crowd explodes into applause and screaming. 1/4 are now dead, and more will soon join them. The woman asks Howie ""what do you think?""

And from within, as though controlling a puppet, the woman's own hand slowly raises and shows a thumbs up gesture.

From within the woman's head, a second, smaller voice speaks: ^""you're ^going ^to ^Vegas, ^baby."""
copypasta,Aggressively fart or shit as loudly as you can.,"Aggressively fart or shit as loudly as you can. I once had to shit in the Walmart bathroom. I walked in and this family walked right in behind me. They were talking really loudly. So I went into a stall to float a log and literally the moment my cheeks hit the seat, some prick started knocking. I was like ""I just sat down"". And he knocked again. I go ""use the other stall"". A moment passes and this fucker knocks again. So I've had enough. I released hell in the form of the loudest, sloppiest spatter house of an ass blasting shit I could've mustered accompanied by growling and the works. They must'Ve got the point because that entire family scattered out of the bathroom as quickly as they could. It's one of my proudest moments."

copypasta,Thank you for sending Deez Nuts again.,"Wow, dude that was really fucking funny. I just went ahead and informed the local neighborhood about this fresh meme you posted, and they all bursted out in laugher, one of them even asphyxiated because he laughed so fucking much at this killer meme. The meme overtook the whole country a matter of minutes, soon expanding to the whole world -- even people without access to the internet were informed about the deep history of this fucking embarrassment of comedy, and they all laughed so hard that those Africans choked on their own, swelling fucking throats and were all wiped out, thus ending world hunger. Later on, NASA de-orbited the ISS and fired Elon Musk and SpaceX to start trying to invent teleportation in an attempt to make your awful fucking meme known to every star in the whole fucking observable universe. Religions and cults have formed around your meme; people think a holy deity must've made it. Thank you for sending this awful fucking garbage, you god damn piece of shit, mother-fucking whore."

soccer,"The best free-kick taker you've never heard of, a clinical carpenter and an answer to Mertesacker: the most fascinating players in the Faroese top flight","The past two weeks have seen /r/soccer go mad over the resumption of the Bundesliga, with each goal making the front page and incredibly original jokes like ""Håland hadn't scored in two months"" confirming this subreddit's reputation as the home of comedy. To be honest, though, I'm not sure exactly why people are so excited about some small beer drinkers league - especially when the real high-level competition, the Betri Deildin, began in the Faroe Islands a full week earlier.

The league has everything that all passionate football aficionados have been missing. Crests with [Vikings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/V%C3%ADkingur_G%C3%B8ta_logo.svg/1024px-V%C3%ADkingur_G%C3%B8ta_logo.svg.png) and [hammers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Havnar_B%C3%B3ltfelag_logo.svg/1024px-Havnar_B%C3%B3ltfelag_logo.svg.png)? Check. [Incredible scenery](https://twitter.com/BallTekkers/status/1235144783963844608)? Check. [Fantasy football](https://fantasy.tv2.no/)? Check. Goal celebrations with no social distancing? Check. (Thanks to early and frequent testing, the Faroes have essentially eradicated coronavirus.)

To introduce /r/soccer's local club supporters, comedic geniuses, and 4K Despacito highlight makers to this incredible competition, here are some of the most interesting players plying their trade in the middle of the North Atlantic.

(I'm not Faroese - most of the information in this post is compiled from various Google-translated Norwegian sites, so if I missed out on any players feel free to point them out in the comments!)

**Adrian Justinussen (Forward, HB, 21 y/o)**

Possibly the best Faroese player in the league at the moment, and definitely the most in-form. This season, he's scored six goals in three matches - yesterday, he plundered four goals and an assist in the first half against AB Argir in a 5-0 win, including a [hattrick of free kicks](https://streamable.com/elziu1). His contributions could be key to HB's title push this season after they finished fourth last year, a disappointment for the islands' most decorated football club.

Despite his incredible dead ball ability, consistency (16 and 20 goals from 26 matches, respectively, in the last two campaigns) and obvious potential, Justinussen is yet to play for the senior Faroese national team - and for a fairly unusual reason. After a flight to Romania with the U19 national side, he developed a fear of flying, making it impossible to travel to away matches outside the country. However, in an interview with Norway's TV 2 three weeks ago, he revealed he had been working with a psychologist and hoped to move abroad next season. In recent weeks, Justinussen has been heavily linked with Icelandic giants Valur, whose manager Heimir Guðjónsson was in charge of HB from 2017 to 2019.

**Klæmint Olsen (Forward, NSÍ, 29)**

While some insightful individuals might consider Ligue 1 a ""farmers' league,"" it would be far more apt to call the Betri Deildin a ""carpenter's league"" given the profession of one of its best players.  Despite working part-time as a carpenter, Klæmint Olsen is the league's all-time top goalscorer with an enviable record of 188 goals from 297 appearances. The Faroes' answer to Alan Shearer even has an inspirational story to go with his impressive feats: he was born with a misalignment in his left foot, making him have to shift all his weight to his right leg when running. Olsen has received offers to play professionally from clubs in Iceland, Denmark, Poland and even Asia, but he prefers to continue working part time - a shame because he's shown the ability to play at a higher level, scoring a [hattrick against Hibernian in Europa League qualifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_d0WEC5AHg) and embarrassing one of the best defences in the world with an [improvised goal from a corner against Spain](https://vimeo.com/341311213) last year. With a new Swedish coach and Olsen's continued dominance in the league (26 goals from 27 appearances last season), NSÍ could be unlikely title contenders this year.

**Sonni Nattestad (CB, B36, 25)**

Per Mertesacker might be the most famous giant to play in the European top divisions, but the Faroes boast their own two-meter ""BFG"" in Sonni Nattestad. The 25-year-old - born in Haiti - is well-traveled, having played for the likes of Midtjylland and AC Horsens in Denmark, Molde and Aalesund in Norway, and FH and Fylkir in Iceland, but returned to his homeland to play for B36 at the start of the year. Nattestad's obvious heading ability has brought him two goals in 25 national team appearances, against Latvia and Liechtenstein, but he hasn't been called up since the end of 2018. Once the coronavirus crisis is over, and with good performances for one of the most consistent teams in the Betri Deildin, it wouldn't be a surprise to see him called up in the future.

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you liked this short writeup, and I'd be happy to do the same for other leagues that are restarting in the future."

Palace remain keen to keep their young star but face losing him for just £250,000 in compensation if he were to leave when his contract runs out next month",
soccer,Preview: Dortmund vs Bayern (Westfalenstadion),"The Bundesliga is back and for the last two weeks has captivated the world of football. However, a couple of my friends have told me, that they’re just not that into it. I have therefore taken it upon myself to write a bit of a preview to set the stage and bring a bit of context to the big game tonight for those of you who have the same feeling my friends had and to try to give a preview of what, in my opinion, is one of the most important games left to be played this season in European football.

With 7 games still to play, Bayern are firmly in the driver seat commanding an impressive 4-point lead over second place Dortmund. The stage is set, tonight 18:30 at the Westfalenstadion one team will take a monstrous step forward in the title race, resulting either in another unfortunate fore gone conclusion or the opportunity to produce an exciting finish to the Bundesliga season.

Both teams are coming into the game off the back of convincing victories, both seemingly unfazed or even emboldened by the eerie Geistspiel atmosphere. Union fought admirably in Buli 26 and will rightful ponder what could have been, if they had had a full Alten Försterei behind them. Dortmund on the other hand have started the second Rückrunde as if there had been no break at all. They seemed completely at ease as they ruthlessly dispatched of Schalke in the Revierderby 4-0 in Buli 26. Wolfsburg put up more of a fight in Buli 27, it would have been extraordinary to be honest if they hadn’t, but nethertheless Dortmund were overwhelming and showed some absolutely top-drawer counter attacking football.

The lack of fan presence will surely benefit Bayern in this fixture but to what extent is not yet completely clear. It’s hard to predict exactly how big of an impact the Geistspiele atmosphere will have on the benefit of home advantage. It is however the new norm and we will have plenty of time to find out.

**Expected line ups and formations**

Dortmund named an unchanged line up in the last two games, however that is likely to change due to the possible addition of Sancho to the starting line up or the possible omission of Hummels due to the nick he picked up on Saturday. Losing Hummels for this game would be utterly devastating and it couldn’t have come at a worse time for Dortmund. If he can’t play Can will take his place and surely give his everything for the cause but against a team like Bayern you absolutely need to have your best team on the pitch.

There has been much speculation due to the recent absence of Sancho from the Dortmund starting lineup especially as he was fit enough to play a combined 36 minutes of the two games post Corona. Dortmund fans will be praying this is just Favre taking extra care with Sanchos reintroduction to the team, one eye firmly locked on tonight’s clash rather than a sign that Sancho’s time at Dortmund could be coming to an end. His tidy assist to kill off Wolfsburg on Saturday will have made his return to the first 11 against Bayern all the more likely. In that case Favre will have a difficult decision ahead deciding who to drop for Sancho. Both Brandt and Hazard have been in top form and I expect he will be reluctant to drop either of them. For this reason, I expect Brandt to be pulled back deeper into Midfield and for Dahoud to make way. I expect Dortmund to line up in a 3-4-3 from left to right as follows:

**Bürki, Akanji, Hummels/Can, Piszczek, Gurreiro, Brandt, Delaney, Hakimi, Hazard, Haaland, Sancho.** *Injuries: Reus (Foot), Zagadou (Knee), Witsel (Muscle), Hummels (Possible injury)*

To come out of this game on top, Dortmund will have to be at their very best and play to their strengths. Overcrowding the midfield and pressing Bayern hard before launching a blistering counter attack into the wide areas to make use of their wing backs, who are in scintillating form, will be the recipe for success. Hakimi and Guerriero have a combined haul of 12 goals and 12 assists for Dortmund in the Bundesliga this season and have been game changing since the restart. Adding to that Hazard, who has had a similarly successful return, Sancho (whos record speaks for itself) and Haaland, you can almost guarantee that Dortmund will be able to punish any mistakes afforded to them.

Bayern have restarted in a similarly commanding fashion. Dispatching of their previous two opponents with relative ease despite the apparent lack of interest in defending set pieces. Hairy moments are fleeting and they know it. Bayern are a cut above the rest of the competition, and this is made consistently apparent as they have notched up 12 wins in their last 13 Bundesliga games, a 0-0 draw with Leipzip the only blemish on a spectacular record. This has propelled them firmly into the driving seat for the Bundesliga title.

The simple fact of the matter is, if Bayern are allowed to play their game they will win. Decent defensively but with an absurd amount of talent in midfield and the front man has been the face of the Bundesliga for many years now. I expect Bayern to line up similarly as vs Frankfurt. That being a 4-2-3-1 with Goretzka and Kimmich holding (yesterday Hansi Flick confirmed Thiago didn't travel with the squad), Coman on the right, Gnarby coming in for Perisic on the left and of course Müller playing the number 10 role and Lewandowski up top, looking to add to his ridiculous 27 goal haul. Speaking of stats, Thomas Müller has, in typical Müller fashion, quietly amassed a hefty 17 assists. Considering he started the season out of favour with former coach Niko Kovac, this tally seems even more impressive. With 7 games still to play, including the game tonight, he has a real chance of breaking Kevin De Bruynes famous 21 assist record season at Wolfsburg in 2013/2014. The full expected line up 4-2-3-1 left to right as follows:

**Neuer, Davies, Alaba, Boateng, Pavard, Goretzka, Kimmich, Gnarby, Müller, Coman, Lewandowski**. *Injuries: Coutinho (Ankle), Tolisso (Ankle), Sule (Knee), Thiago (Adductor).*

If Bayern fall into their rhythm and are consistently able to work the ball around Dortmunds midfield, it seems almost inevitable that they will sooner or later break the Dortmund resistance. Pavard has found a knack for sneaking himself into quite dangerous positions undetected, I could envisage him getting on the end of some early crosses into the box from deep, which I’ve noticed are particularly hard to deal while playing the 3 at the back formations. I attribute this to the lack of big traditional “Edd it” centre backs possessing the pace and technicality to play in a drei Kette.

The game has been naturally billed as Lewa vs Haaland. A clash of titans that has provided a much needed resurgence of excitement around der Klassiker (I’m sorry). In my view however the game will be won in the individual duels in midfield. How well will Dortmund be able to disrupt Bayerns flow? How successful will their press be? Will Bayern respect the pace and ability of Dortmunds wide men and their uncanny consistency of getting the ball into the box exactly to where Haaland needs it and of course, failing that just finishing the chance off themselves? Will the pace of Davies completely cancel Hakimi? Will Dortmund be able to fire themselves up for revenge after the embarrassing 4-0 defeat in November which saw their golden boy Sancho hauled off after 30 minutes for his part in the tragic performance?

Will Dortmund show the world that they aren’t to be counted out just yet, oder wird es wieder Müllern?

In any case, if you haven’t yet been able to hype yourself up for the Bundesliga, there’s never been a better chance. The general consensus is that the fixture run to the finish favours Dortmund giving this game and even further air of importance and possibility. How do you guys think the game will go?"

On 23 May 2020, just two days ago at the time I'm writing this, Bayern Munich defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 to go 4 points a top of the Bundesliga, ahead of second-place Borussia Dortmund. In said game, left-back Alphonso Davies got both an assist to Thomas Müller in the 41st minute to put Bayern up 2-0, and scored one himself to make the scoreline 4-2, twenty minutes later. Alphonso is Canadian, born in a Ghanaian refugee camp, but raised in Edmonton, Alberta. About 7 months earlier, on 26 October 2019, Chelsea had a Premier League match against Burnley away at Turf Moor. Chelsea won the match 4-2, but, if anything, the match is remembered for Christian Pulisic's perfect hat-trick in that game, Not only did that make Pulisic the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick for the club, as well as the first to do it since Didier Drogba in 2010, but it also made him the second American to score a hat-trick in the PL, the first being Clint Dempsey's 3 goals against Newcastle in 2012 to seal a 5-2 victory for the Cottagers.

If you hopped in a time machine and told an avid football fan from 1985 that a Canuck would be a regular feature for one of the best clubs in the world, and a man that would score 5 goals in 3 games shares the same hometown as The Hershey Company itself, you'd currently be residing in Demented Hills. After all, in 1985, Canada and the United States held Elo Ratings of 36 and 60 respectively - there's no way so much could change.

While, as demonstrated earlier, things have gotten much better for both countries footballing-wise, the immediate years following 1985 were horrific for the United States Soccer Federation and the Canadian Soccer Association, however, they were extremely interesting, so I'm gonna talk about them.

&#x200B;

***So why was 1985 such an influential year for the USSF and CSA?***

Do you remember/know about when Pelé, Beckenbauer, and Chinaglia played for the New York Cosmos? When George Best played for the Los Angeles Aztecs, Fort Lauderdale Strikers, and San Jose Earthquakes? How about when Johan Cruijff played for the Aztecs and Washington Diplomats?

All these players played in the North American Soccer League, or the NASL. The NASL, founded in 1968, featured a plethora of teams throughout the US & Canada, and while it was primarily loaded with foreign players, it also gave opportunity for some American talent to arise. Such players include Rudy Glenn, Kyle Rote Jr., Rick Davis, and future Super Bowl winner Chris Bahr. Unfortunately, in 1985, the league folded after deteriorating from 24 to 9 teams, losing teams with great names such as ""Calgary Boomers.""

While the NASL did give a tunnel for Americans like the ones already mentioned to play high-level domestic football, generally, it did a pretty bad job of developing American players. For example, the 1990 World Cup roster featured 0 former NASL players; not one. This wasn't helped either by the fact that, at the time, the USMNT barely ever played games, playing maybe a couple times a year. Canadian players were developed slightly better, the 1982 team, for instance, was a game shy of reaching the World Cup, and only had NASL players to boast.

Either way, the importance placed on big name foreign players and other foreign players who either couldn't quite cut it in their national league, or wanted a bigger paycheck, combined with the lack of a salary cap, put American & Canadian soccer in a very tough spot, one with a huge void, one that we'd see try to be filled several times.

***Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL); b. 1977, d. 1992***

Since the only outdoor soccer teams left were U.S. Open Cup teams in regional teams with long-lasting history, but haven't made much progress due to the lack of promotion and relegation in the US (I'm talking Greek-American, Milwaukee Bavarians, Maccabi Los Angeles, other teams with ethnic names, etc.), the first nationwide league to sweep up the best American talent was one that already existed; the MISL.

MISL was just a little bit different than your average football league though. While most football leagues encourage tactical play, physicality, technicality, all that good stuff, the MISL was like if you took the NASL and put it in an arcade machine. Minifootball, it's called around the world, alters *o jogo bonito* in several significant ways. Smaller pitch with turf, smaller goals, less players, walls; it's somewhat of a cross between futsal, five-a-side, and ice hockey. While there were certainly more Americans and Canadians in this, Joey Fink, Bruce Savage, Juli Veee (amazing name), and many more. However, that doesn't mean they were... good. It also didn't mean that the league was stable either, the only two teams played throughout the entire competition, attendance rarely reached 9,000, and their best ever player was a Yugoslavian who wanted to play in NASL but was banned from FIFA competitions because he defected from his native country. Very cool, FIFA.

Inevitably, the lack of financial stability from the get-go, as well as not being a FIFA-sanctioned league, on top of not really being the same sport as actual association football, were all just too much for the MISL too handle. It folded in 1992, with 7 teams left, halving the 14 teams in the league at it's peak. If anything, the best thing to come out of the MISL was that it inspired the creation of Arena Football, an equally financially unstable version of American football, prioritizing fast pace, big hits, and *touchdowns, baby.*

***Canadian Soccer League (CSL); b. 1987, d. 1992***

We now head to our northern brethren to view the short-lived Canadian Soccer League, the first professional football league predominantly in Canada since the days of Toronto City in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League of the 1960's, featuring legends of the game like the late Sir Stanley Matthews. The main separator between the CSL and other Canadian leagues of the past such as the old 4 major leagues (The Pacific Coast League, The National League of Ontario/Quebec, the aforementioned ECPSL, and the Western Canada League), is that the CSL was *nation-wide*, something the countries hadn't really seen before. This was done as an effort to bring popularity to the sport in Canada, as the 1986 team didn't feature any players playing in Canada - because there were no professional Canadian teams to play for. After the NASL, they just... didn't exist, or were on hiatus. The CSL wanted to change that.

This new CSL league was very brief though, with a rather interesting league structure. Due to travel concerns, instead of playing round robin home-and-away like many leagues, the CSL went round robin for the teams in your division, and one game for those in the opposing division, resulting in 20 games from 8 teams. The top 3 teams per division would make the playoffs, with the 1st seed getting a bye into the semifinal Although the league never really caught on with the Canadian public, it did show some promising signs. The Vancouver Whitecaps were in this league, as well as in the NASL and the next league I'm going to talk about, and still exist today. Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay footballer, was second leading goalscorer in 1989. However, despite those small flashes, the CSL inevitably folded in 1992, leaving the domestic league void wide open in Canada.

***A-League, born American Professional Soccer League (APSL); b. 1990, d. 1996, rs. 1996, d. 2004***

*I'll just preface this by saying that this section will only go over the APSL, as the A-League was never a first-division league, since the MLS had been founded by 1996, successfully ending the ""awkward phase.""*

Soccer in the US & Canada was in a really strange place in 1989. The champions were taken by taking the champions of the two major regional leagues; this year being the east-coast Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Soccer League defeating the Western Soccer League's San Diego Nomads. A year later, in 1990, the ASL and WSL merged to create a super league of sorts; the American Professional Soccer League. Just like when the NFL had it's merger in 1970, the two leagues that formed the APSL were transformed into conferences; the American Conference and the Western Conference. The league started out bright-eyed and bushy-tailed with 22 teams, but, like every other league mentioned here, the lack of attendance numbers combined with exposure issues and travel costs and player salaries - it seemed doomed from the start, in retrospect. There were 32 teams total to ever play in the APSL, but most of them only played one or two years with a sassy name like Los Angeles Salsa and New York Centaurs... Centaurs? Really? Anyway, most of the lasting teams were old NASL clubs (like the Washington Diplomats), most of which still exist today as phoenix clubs in the MLS and USL (the CSL's Whitecaps, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, Seattle Sounders, Impact de Montreal, etc.) The league wasn't all bad, then. A lot of clubs that are central to the core of American and Canadian soccer likely wouldn't have still existed without the APSL; it walked so MLS could run.

***Conclusion***

Soccer in the US & Canada was weird. It was exciting, and it added flavor to the adventurous sports diet. Although all these leagues seemed to fail miserably, they did *just* enough to keep the sport alive, and now, neither country qualified for the World Cup, so what's the point of anything anymore. Goodbye.
